## ENGAGEMENT THESIS FOR A&M

### Situation

Dixon Technologies is India's leading EMS player, manufacturing 50-70% of India's outsourced smartphone volumes (~27M units in 9 months FY26). The company faces a strategic inflection point:

1. **Mature EMS Market:** Smartphone volumes growing 15-20% CAGR; Dixon's market share already leading; limited headroom for margin expansion in core business
2. **Component Manufacturing Imperative:** Global supply chains (China+1) and PLI incentives creating ₹40,000+ Cr ecosystem opportunity in display, camera, and precision component manufacturing
3. **Execution Complexity:** Simultaneously launching four major JVs (HKC display, Q Tech camera, Loncheer smartphone export, Inventec IT hardware) with ₹1,100-1,200 Cr capex over 2 years

### Complication

**Multiple Execution & Market Risks:**

1. **JV Complexity:** Each JV involves global partnerships (HKC, Loncheer, Inventec, Q Tech) requiring PN3 approvals, facility construction, capability building, and profit ramp timelines extending 18-36 months
2. **Margin Pressure Near-Term:** JV startup losses + capex depress EBITDA margins to 3.0-3.5% in FY26-27 vs. historical 3.8%+
3. **Customer Concentration:** Vivo partnership represents estimated 20-30% of mobile revenues; dependency on ODM diversification and Loncheer export scale-up
4. **PLI Uncertainty:** Mobile PLI benefits ₹150-200 Cr annually; expiration March '26 with no guarantee of extension
5. **Global Supply Chain Risk:** US customer orders for telecom backhaul dependent on India remaining competitive vs. China manufacturing

### Implication

**Strategic Opportunity Window (Next 18-24 Months):**

Dixon is positioned to become India's integrated electronics manufacturing champion—transitioning from pure EMS to component-integrated manufacturing. Success could unlock:
- **Revenue Potential:** ₹60,000+ Cr (FY27) → ₹80,000+ Cr (FY28) with JV ramps
- **Margin Expansion:** 3.5% → 4.5-5.0% EBITDA as components scale
- **ROCE Sustainability:** 40%+ maintained through capital discipline and high-margin component mix
- **Valuation Upside:** If JVs execute, current ₹40,000+ Cr market cap could support ₹60,000-80,000 Cr valuation (2-2.5x upside)

**However, execution failures could materially compress value:**
- JV delays could compress FY27 growth 20-30%
- Component margin shortfalls would compress blended EBITDA 100-150 bps
- Customer concentration or export order delays would derisk growth thesis

### Recommended Approach

**A&M Service Lines Aligned:**

1. **PEPI (Platform Economics & Portfolio Initiative) - PRIMARY**
   - **Objective:** Validate component JV economics (Q Tech camera margins, HKC display capex, Loncheer profitability ramps)
   - **Approach:** Deep-dive manufacturing benchmarking; global component manufacturer comparison; JV partnership risk assessment
   - **Deliverable:** Component manufacturing profitability model; JV risk ranking; strategic roadmap for ₹5,000+ Cr component revenue target

2. **CDD (Commercial Due Diligence) - SUPPORTING**
   - **Objective:** Validate growth vector assumptions (mobile export ₹7,000+ Cr, IT hardware ₹3,500+ Cr, telecom ₹3,000+ Cr)
   - **Approach:** Customer concentration analysis; new ODM opportunity sizing; Loncheer partnership validation; US telecom customer win opportunity assessment
   - **Deliverable:** Growth waterfall model; customer concentration risk profile; revenue bridge credibility

3. **Turnaround (Margin Expansion Strategy) - SUPPORTING**
   - **Objective:** Develop margin recovery roadmap post-JV startup phase
   - **Approach:** Operating model optimization; automation opportunity sizing; supply chain cost reduction
   - **Deliverable:** Path to 4.5-5.0% EBITDA margins; cost structure benchmarking vs. global EMS players

4. **Transaction Advisory (Strategic M&A) - FUTURE OPTIONALITY**
   - **Objective:** If component JVs underperform, evaluate M&A options to consolidate supply chains
   - **Approach:** Strategic buyer identification (global EMS + component integrators); acquisition pricing frameworks
   - **Deliverable:** Strategic M&A roadmap if organic growth stalls
