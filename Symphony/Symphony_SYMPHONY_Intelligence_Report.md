## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Symphony Limited is the world's largest air-cooler company by volume and India's dominant market leader, commanding a significant premium over its nearest competitor in the organised household air cooler segment. The company operates a fully asset-light model (100% outsourced manufacturing) with 486 permanent employees, near-zero capital employment in its core India business, and ₹460 crore in treasury. FY24-25 was a landmark year: standalone revenue crossed ₹1,000 crore for the first time (₹1,182 crore, +49% YoY) and EBITDA margin expanded 404 bps to 24.25%. However, FY25-26 is a sharp reversal: a subdued, rain-disrupted summer drove 9M FY26 standalone revenue down 30% to ₹566 crore and EBITDA margin to 14.4%. Management is executing a significant diversification strategy (water heaters, tower fans, kitchen cooling fans, LSV, rural Bharat Range) that generated ~26% of standalone 9M FY26 revenue. A ₹58 crore distributor write-off (Pathways Retail), a rolled-back subsidiary divestiture plan (IMPCO Mexico + CT Australia), and CT Australia's persistent losses are the key governance and structural risks.

## INDICATOR 1: INDUSTRY VOLUME GROWTH (India Air Cooler Market)

### A. Market Size and Structure

**Insight:** The Indian air cooler market has a primary-level TAM of ~₹5,000 crore, with organised players representing approximately 35% of total value. The unorganised segment (metal coolers, regional players) constitutes 65%, providing a structural migration runway.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "At a primary level, the market size is about ₹5,000 crores. Market comprises of different segments or different kind of the players, Symphony being by far the market leader. There are national players as per published report, which many of you are aware. And as per the published report, there are eight players having sales in excess of ₹100 crores. And that too sales in excess of ₹100 crores is at customer level, not at a company level... Organised market share in terms of the value percentage is about 35%."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, January 29, 2026 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Insight:** Published market research covers only a portion of Symphony's actual addressable market. Segments not reported in research (rural/semi-urban, e-commerce, quick commerce, D2C, institutional) constitute 40–50% of Symphony's actual dealer/distributor sales.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "In published research reports to which we as well as many of you have access, it accounts for only some of the segments, the segments which it doesn't account for, but that very much forms part of our sales. And that part of the sales constitutes almost 40% to 50% of Symphony sales to dealers and distributors."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, January 29, 2026 (Nrupesh Shah)

### B. Industry Growth Drivers

**Insight:** Three structural demand drivers are identified: (1) rising temperatures and climate change, (2) transition from metal (unorganised) to plastic (organised) coolers, and (3) income growth and urbanisation.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Drivers Accelerating Shift To Organised Market: Economy formalisation, Consumers increasingly favoring 'plastic coolers', Rising income level & aspiration, Evolving distribution landscape."
**Source:** Corporate Presentation Feb 2026, p.9

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "A bigger chunk of the growth is coming from the movement of consumers from the unorganised to the organized segment. And as I said, the entire metal cooler market is mostly unorganised."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, January 29, 2026 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Insight:** BSI certification norms are expected to structurally shift market share from unorganised to organised, primarily benefiting the market leader.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Such BSI norms are beneficial to organised sector. And as it always happens in any industry, market leader gains the most because it really differentiates the product."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, January 29, 2026 (Nrupesh Shah)

### C. FY25-26 Volume Weakness

**Insight:** FY25-26 summer was subdued (mild, erratic weather) following an exceptionally strong FY24-25 summer. All cooling categories (ACs, fans, coolers) experienced broad-based volume declines. Weakness was most acute in South India.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Revenue during the quarter on a stand-alone basis stands at ₹229 crores, down from ₹373 crores... Revenue is lower on account of shortened and rain-disrupted summer... June '25 sales of ₹229 crores is the second-highest ever for a June quarter, surpassing the sales recorded in earlier summer quarters."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 1, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Insight:** Air cooler penetration remains low (8–9% of households) vs. electric fans (90%+) and air conditioners (~20%), indicating a long structural growth runway.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Air Cooler Penetration (HH in %): Air Conditioner 8-9%, Air Cooler 19%... [projected] Next 5-7 Years [market grows from] ₹5,000 Cr [to] ₹10,000 Cr."
**Source:** Corporate Presentation Feb 2026, p.10

**Confidence:** HIGH — Multiple primary sources corroborate the market structure. Published TAM uses company estimates but is consistently disclosed as such.

## INDICATOR 2: OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

### A. Asset-Light Manufacturing Model

**Insight:** Symphony operates 100% outsourced manufacturing — no permanent workforce at manufacturing facilities, all production contracted to OEMs and CFAs.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "The Company operates on an asset-light and capital-light business model, with manufacturing outsourced to trusted partners. As a result, the Company does not engage a workforce in the traditional sense of permanent workers at manufacturing facilities. Our in-house team is lean and performance-driven."
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25, BRSR Section (p.90)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "% of value chain partners covered... All principles of NGRBC: 100% (OEMs & CFAs)"
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25, BRSR Section

**Insight:** EPACK has been added as a new OEM/contract manufacturer. Symphony owns all product designs and moulds. It will not source generic products.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "EPACK has also become one of our OEMs / contract manufacturers. So, products that we have designed and developed and the moulds of which are owned by Symphony, have been given for a few models to EPACK to produce on our behalf. We will not really just source a product which has not been developed by us."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, February 5, 2025 (Achal Bakeri)

### B. Supply Chain Agility

**Insight:** In the June 2024 bumper summer, Symphony doubled production and supply in 60 days to meet demand, demonstrating exceptional supply chain agility.

**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, January 29, 2026 (Nrupesh Shah)

### C. Headcount and Workforce

**Insight:** Symphony standalone India employs 486 permanent employees (FY25), reflecting the lean asset-light model.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Total employees (permanent): 486 | Employees (permanent) onboarded during the year: 113 | % of employees associated for 5+ years: 50%"
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25, Value Creation section (p.43)

### D. Primary Raw Material

**Confidence:** HIGH — Confirmed across AR FY25, earnings call transcripts Q3FY25 and Q3FY26.

---

## INDICATOR 3: CAPACITY UTILIZATION

**Insight:** Symphony has no fixed manufacturing capacity of its own — all production is through OEMs/CFAs. Therefore, capacity utilization as a traditional metric does not apply. The company's effective "capacity" is determined by its OEM network, which demonstrated scalability (2x in 60 days) in the FY25 summer.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We have succeeded in raising our production as well as supply in just 60 days" (paraphrase confirmed in Q3FY26 transcript), reflecting flexible capacity with no fixed asset constraint.

**Insight:** The company has sold over 25 million air coolers globally since inception, indicating sustained production throughput.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Over 80 years of experience, Symphony has sold over 25 million eco-friendly air-coolers across the world."
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25 (p.41)

**Insight:** With the June 2025 expiry of CT Australia's factory lease (not renewed), CT Australia has also transitioned to a fully outsourced model, completing a multi-year transformation.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Our factory lease expired in July'25, and we have not renewed that. And hence, it is outsourcing in Australia, India and China."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 1, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM — No traditional capacity utilization data is disclosable due to outsourced model. Evidence is inferential.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Even in June quarter, in fact, post 28th February, whatever billing is done, it is without any off-season discount."
**Source:** Q4 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah)

### C. Price Tiering Strategy

**Insight:** Symphony launched the "Air Force" range as a price-warrior product targeting the unorganised metal cooler market, while maintaining premium positioning in the plastic cooler segment.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Air Force emerged as a technology-driven gamechanger that addressed the price, value, and aspiration needs of a consumer who conventionally focused only on the unorganised variant. For Symphony, a brand that has been consistently positioned as premium, we are happy to have launched a price warrior that has taken the fight to the opponent's dressing room; in this case, this 'dressing room' (unorganised sector) comprises 65% of the value of all air-coolers sold in India."
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25 (p.32)

### D. BLDC Premium

**Insight:** BLDC (Brushless DC) versions of air coolers and tower fans are priced at a 10–15% premium over standard products in each category.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Each of these are priced at, give or take, about 10% to 15% premium over the standard non-BLDC products that we have in similar categories."

*Earlier year gross margins estimated from EBITDA and cost structure disclosures.*

### 6B. Margin Drivers

**Insight:** FY25 gross margin improvement (+73 bps to 49.75%) was driven by three factors: (1) 17 new, margin-accretive air cooler models, (2) value engineering, and (3) supply chain streamlining/economies of scale.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "There has also been Y-o-Y gross margin expansion on account of, as guided earlier, launch of 17 new models as well as value engineering and substantially streamlining the supply chain in addition to operating leverage and economies of scale."
**Source:** Q4 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Gross margin expansion: EBITDA margin uplift (+5.12%) reflects — Gross margin gains (+1.16%) — Pricing, Product Mix and Value Engineering — Positive operating leverage" [Consolidated EBITDA bridge]
**Source:** Corporate Presentation Feb 2026 (p.43)

### 6C. D2C Channel Margin Parity

**Insight:** D2C EBITDA margin is equal to conventional general trade margin, indicating no channel dilution from digital expansion.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "During the last financial year, the EBITDA margin generated from D2C revenues was equal to the margin generated through conventional trade channel. The revenues derived from the former... D2C has already turned not only EBITDA, but at a PAT level profitable since last year."
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25 (p.33); Q3 FY26 Transcript (Nrupesh Shah)

### 6D. Q3 FY26 Margin Pressure

**Insight:** Q3 FY26 gross margin declined to 45.2% (from 45.7% in Q3 FY25), partly due to a lower-margin seasonal product mix and higher water heater A&P. 9M FY26 gross margin of 48.3% declined 1.8 ppt YoY.

## INDICATOR 7: GROSS MARGIN — LOCALIZATION / INDIGENIZATION

**Insight:** Symphony India manufactures (through OEMs) primarily in India. The company sources plastic granules and components from Indian vendors. There is no explicit "localization" program as Symphony is India-incorporated, but it has expanded local production of premium models and is transitioning to higher recycled content.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Replaced metallic components with specially engineered plastics... special plastic formulation for fan blades has been developed to drastically reduce breakage"
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25, R&D Section

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "IMPCO Mexico and Climate Technologies were sourcing their products from other suppliers based in China, now that has been synchronized through the expertise and local presence of GSK China."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, February 5, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Insight:** For Australia (CT), the shift from domestic Australian manufacturing (cost A$15mn pa) to 100% outsourcing (India + China) reduced CODB by >50% (to A$7mn).

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We reduced cost of doing the business that is overhead by more than 50% so far. While acquiring it was AUD 15 million and currently, it stands at AUD 7 million."
**Source:** Q4 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM — Localisation context is indirect; explicit cost savings from local sourcing are not quantified for India standalone.

### B. Market Share Stability

**Insight:** Symphony's market share has been broadly stable within a 1–2% band over the past 3–4 years. In FY25-26, volume weakness is industry-wide, not share-related.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "If I look at last three years or four years, within a percent or two kind of band, it has been fairly stable, I would say. And if I look at, let's say, even FY '22, FY '23 versus this year, the data on either side are barely about 1%, 1.5% against the median that we are being enjoying."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, January 29, 2026 (Amit Kumar)

## INDICATOR 9: CONTRACT MANUFACTURING STRATEGY

**Insight:** Symphony's entire India production is contract manufactured. The company owns all product IP and moulds; OEMs manufacture to Symphony's specifications. This model requires zero capex on plant/equipment and allows rapid scaling.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Products that we have designed and developed and the moulds of which are owned by Symphony, have been given for a few models to EPACK to produce on our behalf. We will not really just source a product which has not been developed by us and where we see no product differentiation."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, February 5, 2025 (Achal Bakeri)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Sales to dealers / distributors as % of total sales: 64% [FY25] vs 69% [FY24]; Number of dealers / distributors to whom sales are made: 1,100+ [FY25] vs ~1,000 [FY24]"

## INDICATOR 10: AFTER-SALES SERVICE COSTS

**Insight:** Symphony's after-sales service is delivered through a network of Authorized Service Providers (ASPs). The CRM system enables complaint → SMS → ASP dispatch → technician visit → resolution flow.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Customers can register their complaints through various channels, including the Call Center, WhatsApp, Website, or Speech-to-Text IVR. Upon registration, the customer receives an SMS containing a unique complaint number... The Company's Authorized Service Provider (ASP) then contacts the customer to schedule an appointment... Once the issue is resolved, the technician updates the status in the CRM or through a mobile application."

**Insight:** Symphony sells through five primary channels: (1) General Trade (cash-and-carry, zero-credit policy), (2) Modern Trade / Large Format Stores (Croma, Reliance, Vijay Sales), (3) Regional Chain Stores (Bajaj Electronics, Aditya Vision), (4) E-commerce and Quick Commerce, and (5) Direct-to-Consumer (D2C — profitable at EBITDA margin = conventional trade).

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We do not give credit as a principle to general trade. It is only to modern retail and the regional chain stores or to this e-commerce distributor that we have been giving credit. In the general trade, which still constitutes the vast majority of our sales, we have an absolute zero credit policy."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, February 5, 2025 (Achal Bakeri)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "About D2C sales... it has already turned not only EBITDA, but at a PAT level profitable since last year. And at EBITDA level, its profit margin is in line with our GT sales."

### C. Rural and Semi-Urban Expansion

**Insight:** Rural and semi-urban expansion is a declared strategic priority. Symphony increased penetration through the Bharat Range. Specific rural sales data is not disclosed for competitive reasons.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Decent penetration across — Semi-urban and rural markets... Bharat Range [is growing in] high good double digits"
**Source:** Corporate Presentation Feb 2026 (p.52); Q4 FY25 Transcript (Amit Kumar)

### D. Employee Count

**Insight:** Standalone permanent headcount: 486 in FY25. The company's lean model means the majority of employees are sales and customer-facing professionals, not factory workers.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Total employees (permanent): 486... A significant proportion comprising sales and customer-facing professionals who drive market reach and consumer engagement."
**Source:** Integrated Annual Report FY2024-25, BRSR (p.90)

### E. Credit Risk Event — Pathways Retail

**Insight:** A major credit failure occurred with Pathways Retail Private Limited (Delhi e-commerce distributor, 13-year relationship). Total provision/write-off: ₹58 crore (₹12 crore in FY24 + ₹46 crore in Q3 FY25). Recovery in 9M FY26: ₹8.5 crore. Post-event, Symphony implemented credit insurance for all modern trade and tightened credit evaluation.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We had carried out forensic check and came out with several irregularities, including falsification of the records as well as forgery of government documents etc., and also diversion of funds... Residual outstanding of ₹46 crores from Pathways has been provided for during the quarter as a doubtful debt... all in all ₹58 crores."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, February 5, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah / Achal Bakeri)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Now for entire modern trade, credit insurance has been taken. So for the first time, this credit insurance policy has been taken."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript, February 5, 2025 (Nrupesh Shah)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Confirmed across audited results, multiple quarterly transcripts, and governance disclosures.

## SECTION 14: STRATEGIC SIGNALS SUMMARY

### Opportunities

1. **Unorganised-to-Organised Migration:** 65% of Indian air cooler market is unorganised metal coolers; BSI norms and income growth will accelerate migration, primarily benefiting Symphony (market leader)
2. **Rural and Semi-Urban Penetration:** "Air Force" Bharat Range growing in high double digits; <10% household penetration in rural India
3. **RTY (Round-The-Year) Portfolio:** LSV + tower fans + kitchen cooling fans + water heaters = ~26% of 9M FY26 standalone revenue (up from <10% earlier); growing at 50%+ CAGR
4. **US Export Opportunity:** India-US air cooler tariff regime currently favourable; large US retailers already making inquiries; prior peak US sales of $23 mn possible to rebuild
5. **Mexico-US Corridor:** No tariff on air coolers between Mexico and US, IMPCO Mexico well-positioned to capture US distribution demand amid China tariff disarray
6. **Infinite ROCE Business Model:** Negative capital employed in core India business; treasury (₹460 cr) growing while sustaining 84% PAT payout ratio
7. **BLDC Product Premiumisation:** 10–15% price premium on BLDC coolers and tower fans; early-stage adoption but growing

### Risks

1. **CT Australia Perpetual Losses:** 11+ quarters of consecutive losses; ₹18 cr cash loss in 9M FY26; divestiture rolled back after no acceptable bid — significant accounting treatment expected by March 31, 2026
2. **FY25-26 Volume Shock:** 9M FY26 standalone revenue down 30%; EBITDA down 57%; channel inventory elevated heading into FY26 season. Company now working down inventory glut created by record March 2025 stocking
3. **Pathways Credit Loss:** ₹58 cr written off; ₹8.5 cr recovered so far; lapse in credit management judgment at operating level acknowledged by Chairman
4. **Single Product Category Seasonality:** >74% of standalone revenue from household air coolers (summer-dependent); RTY diversification is still early stage
5. **Subsidiary Drag on Consolidated P&L:** CT Australia generates operating losses; consolidated EBITDA margin (9.5% in 9M FY26) is far below standalone (14.4%) due to subsidiary drag
6. **FY26 Accounting Treatment of CT Investment:** Management guided that CT Australia investment (equity + intangibles) will be "suitably treated" by March 31, 2026 — potential further impairment following ₹50.15 cr taken in FY25
7. **Water Heater A&P Burn:** ₹11 crore Q3 FY26 A&P (90%+ on water heaters) is pressuring EBITDA margins in off-season; payback timeline undisclosed
