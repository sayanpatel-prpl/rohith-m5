### BEE Norm Transition (Effective Jan 1, 2026) -- UPDATED

- **Scope expanded**: Mandatory star ratings now cover TVs, LPG stoves, chillers, cooling towers (previously voluntary). Refrigerators and deep freezers also newly mandated.
- **Testing standards**: Higher ambient temperatures + longer continuous operating hours. A 2025 5-star may only qualify as 3-star under new norms.
- **Price shock**: ACs expected +5-10%, refrigerators +3-5% across the board.
- **Channel stuffing**: OEMs aggressively pushed older BEE-rated stock into secondary/tertiary dealer networks before Jan 1 deadline. Compressed Q3 gross margins.
- **Label validity shortened**: Forces continuous technological improvement cycle.
- **Operational implication**: Companies must upgrade to heavy-duty variable-speed compressors, enhanced polyurethane insulation, smart sensors, and inverter technologies.

> **Feb 2026 CRITICAL NOTE -- Import Dependency Risk Elevated**: The AI-driven commodity shock (copper $12,500/ton, 150K ton shortfall; aluminum tightening; steel +Rs 3,500-4,000/ton) makes import dependency a SEVERE margin risk in Q4 FY26 and FY27. Companies with higher import dependency face: (1) rupee depreciation amplifying USD-denominated raw material costs, (2) procurement lead times extending, (3) spot market buying becoming prohibitively risky. Strategic procurement is shifting to rigid, long-term supply agreements at elevated prices, locking in margin compression. PLI Rs 1,004 Cr + Rs 40,000 Cr electronics scheme are the policy counterweights. [Deep Dive Feb 2026, Sources 3, 26, 28]

## Chart 2: Capacity Utilization vs Localization (Scatter)

This data feeds the `#chartCapacity` scatter/bubble chart. Each company is a point with X = Capacity Utilization %, Y = Localization %.

| Company | Capacity Util. (X) | Localization (Y) | Bubble Size (Revenue FY25 Rs Cr) | Confidence | Feb 2026 Update |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Whirlpool | 78 | 75 | 7,919 | ESTIMATED | -- |
| Voltas | 90 | 74 | 15,413 | VERIFIED/DERIVED | Localization upgraded 72→74 (deep local mfg efficiency driving margin beat) |

### Key Insights for Chart Annotations:
1. **Havells** stands out: highest localization (88%) + high utilization (87%) + largest non-EMS revenue. Q3 FY26 standout performer (14.3% rev growth, 9.2% EBITDA margin)
2. **Dixon** has highest utilization (88%) but lower localization (58%) due to EMS model's component import dependency. Rs 40,000 Cr electronics scheme could transform this
3. **Voltas** has the highest verified utilization (90%) -- 17.9% YTD RAC market share, first Indian company to cross 2M AC units. Localization improving via PLI
4. **Symphony** is an outlier: low localization (55%) because of its 100% outsourced model
5. **IFB** and **Bosch/JCH** are in the "needs improvement" quadrant (low util. + low localization)
6. **Feb 2026 macro risk**: AI-driven commodity shock (copper $12,500/ton) threatens margins for ALL companies with import dependency >20%. Companies in upper-left quadrant (high util + low localization) most exposed

3. **Bajaj Elec**: Lowest premium (15%) -- mass market brand, now acquiring Morphy Richards for premium push
4. **Dixon, Amber**: Low premium control (10-15%) as OEM/ODM manufacturers -- client-driven mix
5. **Industry trend**: Premium fans grew from 12-15% to 25% of category in 5 years; BLDC growing at 50% YoY
6. **Premiumization tailwind**: 9 kg+ washing machines growing 30%, energy-efficient ACs growing 59%, major domestic appliances saw 18% value-based growth in H1 2024

> **Feb 2026 CRITICAL INSIGHT -- Premiumization as a Curve, Not a Line** (Source: A&M / Deep Dive Feb 2026):
> - Premiumization is NOT linear. It rises sharply when benefits are tangible/functional, but aggressively pulls back when price-to-value feels stretched.
> - "Value-first" ≠ "cheap" → "justifiable". Consumers rejecting superficial feature stuffing (touchscreens on basic washers).
> - Winners recalibrating to episodic, contextual premiumization with razor-sharp benefit communication.
> - **BEE norm impact on premium**: 5-10% AC price hikes + 3-5% refrigerator hikes risk wiping out GST-cut demand stimulation. Peak season margins may stay below 5%.
> - **Rs 3 lakh crore home improvement boom**: 40% YoY surge in customized interiors + smart home. 30% increase in modular home solutions. Renovation cycle collapsed from generational to 10-12 years. Premium = integrated ecosystems (built-in kitchen, smart lighting, concealed climate control), not standalone appliances.
> - **Rural demand remains structurally weak**: Urban premium double-digit growth masks flat-to-declining rural volume. Industry top-line resilience is price-hike and mix-driven, NOT genuine volume expansion.

## Notes for Dashboard Implementation

### What changed vs. current mock data:
1. **Capacity Utilization**: Voltas is now 90% (VERIFIED) vs. 82% (mock). IFB drops to 62% from 58%. Dixon stays near 88%. **Feb 2026 updates**: Havells upgraded 85→87 (Q3 FY26 14.3% growth), Blue Star revised 80→78 (subdued Q3), Crompton revised 75→76 (steady growth), Butterfly revised 72→73 (EBITDA improvement).
2. **Localization**: Havells increases to 88% from 87%. Symphony drops to 55% from 88% (reflects 100% outsourced model). **Feb 2026 update**: Voltas upgraded 72→74 (deep local mfg efficiency driving margin beat; PLI Rs 1,004 Cr sustaining momentum).
3. **Contract Mfg**: Symphony corrected to 100% (was 45%). Dixon and Amber corrected to 0% (they ARE the manufacturers, not users of contract mfg).
4. **Product Mix chart**: Added for all 15 companies with Premium/Mass/Economy split based on company disclosures and market positioning. **Feb 2026 context**: premiumization is a "curve, not a line" -- episodic and contextual, not linear.
5. **Dealer Productivity**: Now calculable for 5 companies with DERIVED confidence (Voltas, Blue Star, Crompton, Bajaj Elec, IFB, Havells, Orient).
6. **NEW -- Feb 2026 macro context**: Added comprehensive section covering Q3 FY26 earnings, Union Budget 2026, BEE norms, AI-driven commodity shock, deal flows, M&A dynamics, and strategic market shifts.
7. **NEW -- Commodity Cost Outlook**: Copper $12,500/ton, aluminum tightening, steel +Rs 3,500-4,000/ton. Critical for import dependency interpretation.
8. **NEW -- Deal Flow & M&A**: PE/VC activity (126 deals/$2.7B), Reliance-Kelvinator acquisition, Crompton-Butterfly merger collapse.

### Recency Weighting Protocol:
> When data from multiple time periods exists for the same metric, apply this weighting:
> - **Feb 2026 data** (from Deep Dive, Q3 FY26 earnings): **HIGH** weight -- supersedes older estimates
> - **Q1-Q2 FY26 data** (from company reports in data_sources/): **MEDIUM** weight
> - **FY25 annual data** (from annual reports, Screener/Sovrenn): **BASELINE** weight
> - **Pre-FY25 data**: **LOW** weight -- used only for trend context
>
> Where Feb 2026 sources explicitly contradict older data, the Feb 2026 figure is adopted.

### Metrics still lacking hard data:
- **Vendor Consolidation Index**: No company discloses supplier count/concentration publicly. All estimates based on qualitative signals.
- **Warranty %**: Sits in Notes to Financial Statements (warranty provisions). Would require reading specific pages of annual report PDFs.
- **After-Sales Cost %**: Not separately reported. Embedded in employee costs and other expenses.
- **Dealer Productivity**: Meaningful comparison requires consistent definition (distributor vs. retailer level).

### Recommended data.js updates:
- Remove `mock-data` class from the Operational Intelligence section cards
- Update `operationalMetrics` object with values from this document
- Add source attribution inline (same pattern as Financial Tracker section)
- Product mix data should be added as a new `productMix` object with `premium`, `mass`, `economy` keys per company
- **NEW**: Add `commodityCostOutlook` object for contextual alerts/tooltips on import dependency
- **NEW**: Add `q3FY26Earnings` object for earnings scorecard display
- **NEW**: Add `policyInterventions` array for Budget 2026 and BEE norm alerts
- **NEW**: Consider a `macroContext` section in data.js for the Feb 2026 macro signals (commodity shock, deal flows, market sentiment)
