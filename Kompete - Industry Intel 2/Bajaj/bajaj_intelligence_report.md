# Bajaj Electricals Limited — Financial Market Intelligence Report
**Co-STAR Framework | Consumer Durables Sector | India**
*Analysis Date: February 23, 2026 | Compiled from: Annual Reports FY23–FY25, Q3 FY26 Board Outcome*

---

## Executive Summary

Bajaj Electricals Limited is at a critical inflection point. After completing its EPC Power Transmission demerger (FY24), the company is now a pure-play Consumer Products + Lighting Solutions FMEG. However, FY26 has delivered the company's most severe stress test: 9MFY26 standalone revenue fell **-9.7% YoY** to Rs. 3,210 crores, operating losses materialized in Q3 FY26 (PBT before exceptional: **-Rs. 20.28 crores**), and the Board pre-authorized minimum remuneration payments to directors "in case of absence/inadequacy of profits for FY 2025-26" — an unambiguous admission that management expects **full-year FY26 losses or marginal profits**. An exceptional item of Rs. 28.89 crores for gratuity and leave encashment was booked in Q3, signaling workforce restructuring. The new MD & CEO (Sanjay Sachdeva, appointed March 2025) inherited a company with 53% capacity utilization, a declined retailer base, and a decade-low CP PBIT in FY24.

**Critical Alert: The company is in operating loss territory as of Q3 FY26.**

## 1. Industry vs. Company Growth

### Industry Context
- FMEG sector faced broad demand pressure in FY24–FY25 from consumer caution, urban slowdown, and competitive intensity from Chinese imports and new-age D2C brands
- LED price erosion continued to compress Lighting Solutions revenues across the industry
- Air cooler category surged in FY25 on summer heat wave alignment; ceiling fans underwent BEE-driven product refresh
- E-commerce channel faced "significant demand pressures" and "competitive disruption" (company language, FY25 AR)
- Quick commerce emerged as a new channel, gaining traction in urban/semi-urban markets

### Bajaj vs. Industry (Continuing Operations: Consumer Products + Lighting Solutions)

| Period | Revenue (Rs. cr) | YoY Growth | Commentary |
|---|---|---|---|
| FY22 | 4,813 | — | Includes EPC |
| FY23 (restated, ex-EPC) | 4,889 | +1.6% | EPC demerger in progress |
| FY24 | 4,641 | -4.9% | Demand headwinds; CP contracted -4.3% |
| FY25 | 4,828 | +4.0% | Recovery; air cooler +65%; trade +6% |
| Q3 FY26 (Qtrly) | 1,048 | -5.0% | Demand collapse resumes |
| 9MFY26 | 3,210 | -9.7% | Sharp deterioration |

**Key Signal:** The recovery narrative of FY25 (+4%) has been sharply reversed in FY26. Bajaj appears to be losing ground relative to industry, particularly in its core Consumer Products business.

**Trade Channel Recovery (FY25):** H2 growth of 7.5% vs H1 of 3.3% — positive second-half momentum that has not sustained into FY26 Q3.

## 2. Operational Intelligence

### Manufacturing Footprint
- **Sites:** 4 manufacturing plants (Chakan, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nashik + 1)
- **Capacity — Consumer Products:** 10.8 Mn units installed; 4.6 Mn produced (43% utilization)
- **Capacity — Lighting Solutions:** 18.8 Mn units installed; 11.2 Mn produced (60% utilization)
- **Warehousing:** 31.5 lakh sq.ft. across network
- **Offices:** 19 pan-India
- **R&D Team:** 170 engineers (FY25) vs 176 (FY24) vs 184 (FY23) — declining headcount signal

### SKU Activity
| Year | Consumer Products SKUs | Lighting Solutions SKUs | Total New |
|---|---|---|---|
| FY23 | 18 patents filed | — | — |
| FY24 | 467 | 553 | 1,020 |
| FY25 | 257 | 672 | 929 |

### Domestic Sourcing
- Consumer Products: >90% domestic (FY24), improving
- Lighting Solutions: >99% domestic — near-full localization
- **Benefit:** Insulation from import volatility and FX risk; cost structure stability

### Supplier Base
- 288 supplier partners (FY25)
- Nashik plant LED line fully automated (manual → automated assembly and packing line) — productivity and cost efficiency signal

---

## 3. Capacity Utilization

| Year | Capacity Utilization (Overall) | CP Utilization | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FY23 | 57% | — | Includes EPC production |
| FY24 | 50% | — | Post-EPC demerger, pure FMEG base |
| FY25 | 53% | 43% | Slight recovery but deeply underutilized |
| 9MFY26 | Not disclosed | — | Volume decline of -9.7% implies further deterioration |

**Critical Finding:** Consumer Products utilization at 43% in FY25 represents severe overcapacity. With 9MFY26 revenue declining another 9.7%, realized FY26 capacity utilization is almost certainly below 40%. This creates significant fixed-cost absorption pressure — a key driver of the Q3 FY26 operating loss.

**Implication:** The company is not growing into its installed capacity. Capital has been deployed (4 plants, 31.5L sq.ft. warehouse) for a volume level that is not materializing.

## 4. Pricing Strategy

### Multi-Brand Architecture
| Brand | Positioning | Key Categories | FY25 Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| BAJAJ | Mass-value, "Built for Life" | Appliances, Fans, Coolers | Demand pressure; +65% in coolers |
| Nex | Modern/youth | Fans, Appliances | Quiet performance; positioned for premiumization |
| Morphy Richards | Premium, aspirational | Kitchen appliances, Irons | Strong growth — premium segment outperforming |
| Nirlep | Cookware specialist | Cookware | Niche positioning |

### Pricing Strategy Signals
- **Premiumization drive:** Extended warranty on 23 SKUs (doubled lifespan), premium features on Mixer Grinders (military-grade MIL-STD-810H jars)
- **Price positioning strengthened** at retail level in FY25 — company increased visibility and price control
- **Performance-linked channel partner incentive** rolled out in Q4 FY25 — demand creation via trade push
- **Brand Investment:** Rs. 140.4 crores in FY25 (approx. 2.9% of revenue) — sustained brand spend despite pressure
- **"BUILT FOR LIFE" → "BUILT TO SHINE"** campaign pivot in Lighting Solutions

**Risk:** Premium positioning while volumes decline suggests demand is not elastically responding to price/brand signals. The BAJAJ mass brand still accounts for the bulk of volume and is underperforming.

| EPS (Basic, after exc.) | (2.53) | — | — | — | — | — |

**JV Share of Loss (Consolidated):** Rs. 489 lakhs (Q3FY26), Rs. 1,039 lakhs (9MFY26) — JV dragging consolidated performance further.

### Key Cost Observations
- **Employee costs declining** (FY24: higher → FY25: lower); Q3FY26 employee cost Rs. 91.1 cr vs Q3FY25 Rs. 106.6 cr — restructuring benefit but signals headcount reduction
- **Other expenses surged:** Q3FY26 Rs. 215.4 cr vs Q3FY25 Rs. 183.2 cr = +17.5% — cost escalation in a revenue-declining quarter is highly concerning
- **Finance costs flat:** Q3FY26 Rs. 12.78 cr vs Q3FY25 Rs. 12.69 cr — no meaningful deleveraging
- **Interest coverage ratio deterioration:** 3.7x (FY24) → 3.1x (FY25) → likely <1x in FY26 annualized
- **Surplus funds:** Rs. 509 crores (FY25) — liquidity buffer exists but being drawn down

## 6. Gross Margin Strategy

### Segment-Level Profitability
| Segment | FY22 PBIT | FY23 PBIT | FY24 PBIT | FY25 EBITDA | Revenue FY25 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Consumer Products | Rs. 226 cr | Rs. 247 cr | Rs. 114 cr | Rs. 253 cr | Rs. 3,806 cr |
| CP Margin | ~5.9% | ~6.4% | ~3.2% | ~6.6% | — |
| Lighting Solutions | Rs. 59 cr | Rs. 87 cr | Rs. 80 cr (7.7%) | Rs. 81 cr | Rs. 1,023 cr |
| LS Margin | ~7.7%(?) | ~8.4% | 7.7% | 7.9% | — |

### Gross Margin Signals
- **EBITDA margin flat at 7.5%** (FY24 = FY25) despite revenue recovery — cost pass-through, not margin expansion
- CP PBIT collapsed to 3.2% in FY24 (demand + competition pressure), recovered to ~6.6% EBITDA in FY25
- **MD notes "improvement in gross margins"** in FY25 letter — domestication of supply chain and premiumization driving mix improvement
- FY26 Q3 trend reversal is worrying: if EBITDA margin was 7.5% on Rs. 4,828 cr, it is clearly negative on Rs. 3,210 cr 9MFY26 pace

---

## 7. Localization

### Supply Chain Domestication
| Category | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domestic Sourcing — CP | ~90% | 90%+ | >90% |
| Domestic Sourcing — LS | ~95%+ | >99% | >99% |

**Signals:**
- Lighting Solutions has achieved near-complete import substitution — fully domestic LED supply chain
- Nashik plant's LED assembly line automation completed in FY25 — manufacturing efficiency and quality milestone
- Consumer Products still at ~90% domestic, implying ~10% import exposure (primarily premium/specialized components)
- **BEE star rating compliance** for fans and coolers driving product line refresh; domestic compliance advantageous over imports
- No mention of PLI scheme participation in available documents (possible gap vs peers like Amber)

---

## 8. Market Share

### Market Position (No Explicit Share Data Available)
- **Fans:** Top 3 brand nationally; BEE 5-star rated products launched
- **Mixer Grinders/Appliances:** BAJAJ is a legacy leader but facing D2C and Chinese competition
- **Lighting Solutions:** Significant player in B2B (professional lighting) and B2C; order book maintained despite LED price erosion
- **Air Coolers:** Company-disclosed +65% growth in FY25 — outperforming market; BEE-compliant models
- **Morphy Richards:** Premium kitchen category growing; specific share not disclosed

### Channel Market Share Signals
| Channel | FY25 Trend | Share of CP Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| Trade (traditional) | +6% YoY; H2: +7.5% | ~57% (estimate) |
| Alternate (MT + e-comm) | Subdued, single digit | ~43% |
| Modern Trade (NFR + RFR) | +15% | ~13% |
| Quick Commerce | Gaining rapidly | Small but growing |

**Retailer Base Decline:** 2 lakhs+ (FY24) → ~1.7 lakhs (FY25) — a **15% decline in retail reach**. This is a significant market share risk signal — fewer touchpoints means reduced off-take and competitive vulnerability.

---

## 9. Contract Manufacturing

### Manufacturing Model
- **In-house dominant:** 4 plants, 10.8 Mn CP + 18.8 Mn LS installed capacity
- **Third-party sourcing implied:** Traded goods purchases (Rs. 55,244 lakhs in Q3FY26 vs raw materials Rs. 13,500 lakhs) suggests significant buy-and-sell / outsourced manufacturing for certain SKUs
- **Ratio analysis:** Traded goods constitute ~73% of material costs in Q3FY26 — suggests significant proportion of products are contract-manufactured or procured finished/semi-finished
- **Pattern:** Consistent with FMEG model where core products are manufactured and commoditized/seasonal SKUs are outsourced

**Risk:** High traded goods dependency means margin dilution when volume falls (no fixed-cost leverage from own plants on outsourced volumes).

---

## 10. After-Sales Service Costs

### Service Network
| Metric | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customer Care Centers | N/A | 660 | 660+ |
| Pin Codes Served | N/A | 19,356 | 19,000+ |

### Key Signals
- **Warranty extension on 23 SKUs** (doubled lifespan) under "Built for Life" — intentional quality/cost commitment; raises future warranty provisioning
- **Service-type warranties bundled** with products — recognized as a performance obligation under Ind AS 115; warranty cost embedded in P&L
- **Exceptional item Rs. 28.89 crores** for gratuity and leave encashment in Q3 FY26 — signals employee retrenchment or large-scale restructuring of service/field force
- **Brand investment Rs. 140 crores** includes post-sale engagement; customer satisfaction survey cadence noted
- **Consumer Products warranty in FY25:** Increasing risk as product base ages and extended warranties are claimed
- **Care center network flat** at 660 despite revenue growth ambitions — no investment in after-sales expansion

---

## 11. Retail Footprint

### Distribution Network
| Metric | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dealer Base | — | 732 | >700 | 850+ |
| Retailer Base | — | ~2 lakhs | 2 lakhs+ | ~1.7 lakhs |
| Care Centers | — | — | 660 | 660+ |
| Pin Codes Served | — | — | 19,356 | 19,000+ |
| Channel Partner Retention | — | — | — | 81% |

### Retail Footprint Analysis
**Positive:**
- Dealer base grew from 700+ (FY24) to 850+ (FY25) = +21% — indicates improved distributor/super-stockist enrollment
- Rural outreach deepened through super stockist network
- Quick commerce deployment aligns with urban demand shift
- Modern trade (NFR/RFR) +15% growth — brand gaining prominence in organized retail

**Negative:**
- Retailer base declined from 2 lakhs+ (FY24) to ~1.7 lakhs (FY25) = **-15% reduction in outlets** — significant reach loss
- Pin codes covered declined marginally: 19,356 → 19,000+ — some rural penetration lost
- Channel partner retention only 81% — **1 in 5 partners did not renew** in FY25
- DMS and digital tools are in deployment but not yet translating to footprint retention

**Structural Concern:** Growing dealer base but shrinking retailer base suggests the company is consolidating upward (fewer, larger partners) while losing the long-tail retailer coverage that typically drives FMEG volume growth in India.

---

## 12. Governance and Leadership

### Leadership Changes (High-Risk Signal)
- **MD & CEO:** Departed; replaced by Sanjay Sachdeva (appointed March 28, 2025)
- **COO — Consumer Products:** Also departed
- **New Independent Director:** Pramod Agrawal (Feb 2026 board meeting)
- **Minimum Remuneration Pre-approval:** Board approved minimum remuneration for directors "in case of absence/inadequacy of profits for FY 2025-26" — admission of anticipated losses

### Strategic Milestones
- EPC demerger completed FY24 — company is now pure FMEG
- Surpassed target of making EPC profitable on operating basis before exit
- FY25: 38 patents filed, 5 patents granted, 63 design registrations
- CSR spend: Rs. 4.7 crores (FY25); 7 projects
- Great Place to Work certification (FY24 noted)

### Asset Monetization
- **Sion office property sold** for Rs. 26.53 crores (Q3 FY26 board meeting) — non-core asset disposal, cash preservation signal
