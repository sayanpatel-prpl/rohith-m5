However the NWC improvement is driven by payables growth (supplier leverage) rather than reduction in gross inventory days (67 days) or receivable days (66 days). Underlying WC intensity is unchanged — only the financing of that WC through payables has improved.","INVESTOR_ANALYST (Q4 FY25); INTEGRATED_GOVERNANCE (CRISIL Nov 2025)","Lines 169-170; 176"
41,Market Share — RAC Manufacturing Leadership,"Amber holds 26-27% market share of the outsourced RAC manufacturing market in India (FY24: 27.3%; FY25: 26-27%). Market share broadly stable over the period.",Positive,FY24-FY25,Informational,"Dominant market position in outsourced RAC contract manufacturing. However the outsourced RAC manufacturing market (the relevant denominator) is itself at risk of contraction as brands take assembly in-house. Being the largest player in a potentially shrinking addressable market has limited long-term value without the strategic pivot to components/ODM succeeding.","INVESTOR_ANALYST (Q4 FY24; Q4 FY25); INTEGRATED_GOVERNANCE (CRISIL Nov 2025)","Lines 271-274"
42,Governance — CRISIL AA-/Positive Credit Rating,"CRISIL AA-/Positive rating as of November 2025. Total bank facilities rated Rs. 3252 Cr. Interest coverage 3.87x. Rs. 2750 Cr equity raised in FY26. Adjusted net worth Rs. 2310 Cr as of March 2025.",Positive,Nov 2025,Informational,"Strong credit rating provides low borrowing cost advantage. However the positive outlook is contingent on sustained ~8% EBITDA margins and no significant debt-funded capex deterioration — both of which are at risk given the Rs. 4200 Cr PCB pipeline and thin PAT margins. Rating could face pressure if leverage increases materially from current 1.32x D/E.","INTEGRATED_GOVERNANCE (CRISIL Nov 2025)","Lines 429-431"
43,Localization Strategy — Backward Integration Progress,"Systematic backward integration across RAC and Electronics value chain since 2013: AC motors (PICL 2013); PCB assembly (ILJIN 2017); PCB manufacturing (Ever Electronics 2018); HVAC/Railway (Sidwal 2019); bare PCB (Ascent FY23); advanced PCB/HDI (Ascent-K JV FY25); UPS/solar (Power One Aug 2025); industrial automation (Unitronics Oct 2025); multi-layer PCB (Shogini Dec 2025).",Positive,FY13-FY26 (ongoing),Informational,"Backward integration is the correct strategic response to both commodity cost vulnerability and customer in-sourcing risk. However the pace of integration (9 acquisitions over 12 years including 3 in the last 12 months) creates integration complexity and governance risk that partially offsets the strategic benefits.","INVESTOR_ANALYST (all four); INTEGRATED_GOVERNANCE (CRISIL Nov 2025)","Lines 235-243"
