## 1. Industry vs Company Growth

**Insight:** TTK Prestige grew 1.2% overall in FY25 (Rs. 2,501 → Rs. 2,530 Crores), suppressed by ~Rs. 125 Crores of lost sales from MFI/rural channel collapse. Adjusting for this disrupted channel, underlying growth was ~7% — management explicitly stated this is "exactly equal to the industrial, little better than industrial." The industry is re-entering positive growth after a prolonged flat phase, with appliances growing fastest, followed by cookware, then cookers.

| Metric | FY25 | FY24 | Delta |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Total Sales (Standalone) | Rs. 2,530.3 Cr | Rs. 2,500.7 Cr | +1.2% |

> *"Netting-off for the MFI channel, our growth should be hovering around 7%, which is reasonably good growth."*
> — MD CEO, Q4 FY25 Earnings Call

> *"If you remove these channels which were not there from both last year and this year, our growth will be more than 7% or 8% which is exactly equal to the industrial, little better than industrial."*

## 4. Pricing Strategy and Commodity Cost Impact

**Insight:** Aluminium price escalation in H2 FY25 forced a targeted price increase on aluminium products in November 2024. This is the primary commodity cost pass-through event of the year. The company maintains strict cross-channel price parity, resisting arbitrage and predatory discounting. Strategy is premiumization-led — SS tri-ply, cast iron, high-end appliances at the Prestige brand level, with the Judge brand serving value-for-money buyers.

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Key Commodity Risk | Aluminium (dominant in pressure cookers and cookware) |
| Price Action Taken | Price increase on aluminium products — November 2024 |
| Cross-Channel Pricing | Uniform pricing enforced across all channels (no arbitrage) |
| Industry Pressure | Competitors increased promotions/discounts; TTK resisted predatory pricing |
| Premium Strategy | SS tri-ply, cast iron, high-end appliances under Prestige brand |
| Value Strategy | Judge brand — Tier-2/Tier-3, income-segment targeting |
| Aluminium Trend | Rising H2 FY25; some pause noted post-FY25 year-end |

> *"The commodity prices especially aluminium has seen an increasing trend from the fag end of the first half of the year pushing the Company to resort to price increase on its aluminium products in Nov 2024 to neutralise any impact of these on the gross margins during the year."*
> — Annual Report, MD&A

> *"We proactively minimised the conflict among the various channels without compromising on product offerings and without succumbing to predatory pricing pressures."*

## 5. Cost Structure Strategy

**Insight:** TTK Prestige operates a hybrid cost model — ~48% of revenue is own-manufactured (direct cost-intensive), ~52% is traded/sourced appliances (purchase of stock-in-trade driven). Aluminium is the dominant commodity input. The Rs. 200 Crores OPEX investment program is incrementally raising the "Other Expenses" base. Renewable energy investments are underway across all major plants as a long-term energy cost management play.

### Standalone P&L Cost Structure — 9 Months FY25 (April–December 2024)

| Cost Line | Rs. Crores | % of Revenue |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Revenue from Operations | 1,926.5 | 100% |

## 6. Gross Margin Strategy and Trade-offs

**Insight:** Reported FY25 EBITDA margin contracted to 13.4% from 15.4% in FY24. However, before the Rs. 29.8 Crores of strategic investments, EBITDA margin was 14.6% — much closer to PY. Management's long-term target is to return to mid-teen margins (14-15%) last achieved in FY20. The company explicitly does not operate a "margin-led" policy but rather pursues growth with healthy ROCE.

### EBITDA Trend — Standalone (Rs. Crores)

| Year | Net Sales | EBITDA | EBITDA % | Op. EBITDA % |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| FY21 | 2,033 | 342 | 16.8% | — |

## 7. Localization Strategy (Import vs Domestic Manufacturing)

**Insight:** TTK Prestige has deliberately resumed selective China imports in FY25 to capture new product categories and innovative designs. The strategy is explicitly staged: source from China → replicate → indigenize. The company's own manufacturing covers ~48% of turnover; ~52% is marketed/distributed (traded or outsourced). All factory automation at Hosur was developed indigenously (no technology imported). Exports represent 2.68% of turnover across 21 countries.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Own Manufacturing (% revenue) | ~48% — Pressure Cookers, Cookware, Gas Stoves |
| Traded/Sourced (% revenue) | ~52% — Kitchen Appliances |
| China Imports Resumed | Yes — FY25; for new product categories and innovative models |
| Indigenization Plan | Explicit — replicate China designs, manufacture in India over time |
| China exposure level | "Not very high" (management statement) |
| Import of Raw Materials | Rs. 8.93 Crores FY25 (vs Rs. 7.31 Crores FY24) |
| Capital Goods Imports | Rs. 0.09 Crores FY25 (minimal) |
| Technology Imports | Nil — automation at Hosur developed indigenously |
| Export Revenues | Rs. 67.9 Crores (2.68% of total turnover) |
| Export Markets | 21 countries |
| PLI Participation | NOT DISCLOSED in any FY25 document |

> *"Your Company has resumed its imports from China during the year to bring in new product categories and innovative models. Your Company has plans to indigenous the manufacturing for these products over a period of time."*
> — Annual Report, MD&A

> *"We consciously ensure that we have a better indigenization ratio that helps us both in terms of cost as well as in terms of control."*

## 8. Market Share Trend

**Insight:** Market share was lost over FY22–FY24 (post-COVID competitive dynamics). FY25 marks an inflection — the company reports "marginal improvements in market share in most categories." 191 new SKUs, distribution gap-filling, and portfolio completions (cast iron, SS tri-ply) are driving recovery. The Rs. 500 Crore transformation program is explicitly anchored to regaining and then expanding market share.

| Category | Market Position | FY25 Trend |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Pressure Cookers | Market Leader (value + volume) | Stable — improvement noted |
| Cookware | Leader | Gaining — +7.3% revenue growth; nonstick +14% Q4 |
| Gas Stoves (value-added) | Leader | Stable |
| Induction Cooktops | Leader | Stable (category declined -10% FY25 full year) |
| Kettles | Leader | Stable |
| Mixer Grinders | Competitive | Stable |
| Appliances | Competitive | Recovering |

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Market share direction | Lost (FY22-FY24) → Recovering (FY25) |
| Key recovery levers | 191 new SKUs; cast iron and SS tri-ply portfolio completion; distribution expansion |
| Judge Brand | Rs. 68 Crores FY25 (+43% YoY from Rs. 47 Crores) — Tier-2/3 value segment |
| Target scale | Rs. 5,000 Crores (from Rs. 2,800 Crores current) |

> *"Company continues to maintain leadership positions in all the key categories… and has seen marginal improvements in its market share in most of these categories."*
> — Annual Report, MD&A

> *"We did lose market share over the few quarters but suffice to say that we started regaining market share."*
> — MD CEO, Q4 FY25 Earnings Call

## 9. Contract Manufacturing Strategy

**Insight:** ~52% of revenue comes from traded/sourced products (primarily appliances), indicating significant external manufacturing reliance. The company refers to "manufacturing capabilities with partners" in appliances. China imports were resumed for new categories with a stated indigenization roadmap. Specific contract manufacturer names, contract structures, and outsourced volumes are not publicly disclosed.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Trading model revenue | ~52% of total (Kitchen Appliances segment) |
| Own manufacturing | ~48% of total (Cookers, Cookware, Gas Stoves) |
| China sourcing | Resumed FY25 — new categories, innovative designs |
| Indigenization direction | Explicit plan to replicate and manufacture locally over time |
| Partner manufacturing (appliances) | Referenced but vendor names NOT DISCLOSED |
| Raw material imports | Rs. 8.93 Crores FY25 (+22% vs FY24) |
| Future CAPEX for in-housing | Stainless steel tri-ply and select appliances identified |

> *"We have made some investments with some of our partners in terms of manufacturing capabilities, in terms of indigenizing some of our categories."*

## 10. After-Sales Service Cost Signals

**Insight:** The service network expanded from 476 to 487 centers in FY25, indicating active service infrastructure investment. Specific after-sales service cost is **not broken out** as a standalone line item — absorbed within "Other Expenses." Distribution expenses (partially related to service) are Rs. 26.56 Crores on a partial-year standalone basis.

| Parameter | FY25 | FY24 |
|-----------|------|------|
| Service Centers | 487 | 476 |

## 11. Retail Footprint / Distribution / Manpower Scale

**Insight:** TTK Prestige maintains one of the most extensive branded retail networks in Indian kitchenware — 667 Prestige Xclusive stores across 314 towns, with an aspirational target of 1,000 stores. The MFI/rural channel collapse accelerated the strategic shift toward urban e-commerce and modern retail. GramyaHaat investment signals a new attempt to address deep rural markets through a digital platform.

| 5 | Judge brand — 43% growth, Rs. 68 Crores; large Tier-2/3 value-for-money segment untapped | High |
| 6 | Rs. 500 Crore transformation — if executed, targets double-digit growth and 14-15% EBITDA | Medium (execution risk) |
| 7 | Rural market recovery via GramyaHaat — Rs. 5 Crore investment in rural distribution network | Low (early stage) |

### Key Risks

| # | Risk | Signal Strength |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | EBITDA margin dilution — transient but 8-quarter horizon of investment drag | High |
| 2 | Aluminium price volatility — primary commodity; Nov 2024 price hike already taken | High |
| 3 | UK subsidiary stress — Horwood operating loss, Rs. 71.4 Crores consolidated goodwill impairment | High |
| 4 | MFI/rural channel structural decline — Rs. 125 Crores FY25 revenue loss; recovery uncertain | Medium |
| 5 | Competitive intensity from unorganized/regional players via e-commerce at lower price points | Medium |
| 6 | Execution risk on transformation — new MD CEO since Oct 2024, consultants engaged, complex CAPEX+OPEX | Medium |
| 7 | Ultrafresh cash losses deepening — EBITDA worsened to Rs. (9.3) Crores | Low-Medium |

### Cost Direction

> **Near-term (FY26):** Cost increases — Rs. 200 Crores OPEX program ramping + aluminium inflation
> **Medium-term (FY27-28):** Cost savings from automation (44 robots + more), renewable energy, supply chain optimization
> **Long-term:** Mid-teen EBITDA margins (14-15%) as investments mature
> **Balance Sheet:** Debt-free; Rs. 825 Crores cash (post-buyback Rs. 248.8 Crores, post-CAPEX, post-dividend) — fully self-funding

### Market Position Direction

From loss → stabilization → recovery. Targeting Rs. 5,000 Crores scale from current ~Rs. 2,530 Crores. Store count aspirational target: 1,000 from 667. Leadership positions maintained; product portfolio gaps closed. Two-brand strategy: Prestige (premium/urban) + Judge (value/Tier-2/3).
