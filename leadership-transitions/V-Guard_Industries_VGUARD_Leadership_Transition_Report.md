## Strategic Interpretation

1. **Founder Transition Complete:** Kochouseph Chittilappilly's stepping down as Chairman Emeritus at 75 years marks the full transition of V-Guard from founder-led to next-generation management under his son Mithun K Chittilappilly (MD). This is a significant governance milestone for a family-founded company.

2. **MD Continuity Assured:** Mithun K Chittilappilly's re-appointment for another 5-year term (from April 2026) signals long-term management stability and confidence in the current strategic direction.

3. **Board Strengthening:** The appointment of Dr. Reena Philip as an additional Non-Executive Director suggests the board is adding new perspectives, possibly in areas complementary to the existing composition.

4. **Business Unit Leadership Gap:** Manoj Dalal's departure as Business Head for Switches & Switchgears creates a gap in a key product category. No replacement announcement found.

## Evidence Gaps & Open Items

- Replacement for Business Head – Switches & Switchgears (Manoj Dalal) not confirmed
- Dr. Reena Philip's appointment subject to shareholder approval (e-voting ongoing)
- Prof. Biju Varkkey's re-appointment as Independent Director (2nd term from May 2026) pending shareholder approval
- No information found on CFO or other C-suite changes during this period
