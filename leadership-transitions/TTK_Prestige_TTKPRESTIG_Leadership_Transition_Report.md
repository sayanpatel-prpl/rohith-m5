## Strategic Interpretation

1. **Generational Succession:** The most significant event is the planned promoter succession — T T Jagannathan's stepping down after 50 years, with T T Raghunathan (on board since 1995) becoming Chairman and Dr. Mukund T T becoming Vice Chairman. This represents a multi-decade family succession planning exercise.

2. **Massive Board Renewal:** Four independent directors completing their terms simultaneously (March 2025) and being replaced by four new directors (Prabhakar Jain, Girish Rao, Dhruv Moondhra, Sandhya Vasudevan) represents the largest board renewal in TTK Prestige's recent history, bringing fresh governance perspectives.

3. **Founder's Passing:** T T Jagannathan's demise in October 2025, just months after his formal retirement, marks the end of an era. The fact that succession was already completed ensures continuity.

4. **Technology Leadership Investment:** The appointment of a new CTO (Tamilselvan Sankaralingam) alongside the departure of the CIT Officer suggests a strategic shift in technology leadership toward product/manufacturing technology rather than IT operations.

## Evidence Gaps & Open Items

- Exact appointment dates for Dhruv Moondhra and Sandhya Vasudevan not confirmed from available sources
- Replacement for Chief Information Technology Officer (Ramasubramaniam R) not yet announced
- Chandru Kalro's formal end date as MD (October 2024) falls slightly outside the strict time window
