## 4. Strategic Interpretation

- **Holding Company Influence:** Shantanu Khosla's exit reflects changes at the holding company (Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals) level rather than internal Butterfly dynamics.
- **Operational Strengthening:** The appointments of Somasundaram P (Manufacturing) and Muthu Saravanan K (Marketing) indicate a focus on building operational capabilities in manufacturing and go-to-market functions.
- **Board Thinning:** With Maheshwari Mohan's term ending and Shantanu Khosla's resignation, the Board lost two members. No replacements have been announced yet, which may indicate upcoming board appointments.
- **Senior Management Turnover:** The resignation of the Head of Procurement (Senthil Kumar Raja S) represents turnover in a key supply chain role.
