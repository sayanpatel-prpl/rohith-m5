- **Manufacturing Stability:** The quick replacement of Senthil Balasubramanian (who left after just one year) with Manish Jha from Tata Motors/Tata Cummins ensures manufacturing continuity during a critical capacity expansion phase.
- **Board Refresh:** The replacement of Sam Balsara with M S Unnikrishnan (former Thermax MD) brings deeper industrial and engineering expertise to the Board.
- **Leadership Continuity:** B Thiagarajan's re-appointment ensures continuity at the MD level through May 2027.
