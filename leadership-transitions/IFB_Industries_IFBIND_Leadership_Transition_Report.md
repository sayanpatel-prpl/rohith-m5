- **Service Business Continuity:** Amar Singh Negi's re-appointment ensures stability in the service vertical, which is key for IFB's home appliance after-sales business.
- **Stable Core Leadership:** No changes in the top management (Chairman & MD, divisional MDs, CFO) indicate leadership stability.
