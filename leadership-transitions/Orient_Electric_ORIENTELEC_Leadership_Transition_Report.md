## Strategic Interpretation

1. **Finance & Risk Leadership Refresh:** The CFO transition from Saibal Sengupta (retirement) to Arvind Vats, who also takes on the Chief Risk Officer role, reflects planned succession with expanded scope — indicating increased focus on enterprise risk management.

2. **Manufacturing & Operations Restructuring:** Bhagirath Singh Galgat's departure from Manufacturing Excellence and the subsequent designation of Rakesh Sorout as Head Manufacturing Operations in November 2025 suggests a reorganization of the manufacturing function.

3. **Business Unit Realignment:** The appointment of Ajay Saraf as BU Head for Switchgear and Wires, and the departure of BU Head Tapas Roy Chowdhury, indicate a reshaping of the company's business unit leadership structure.

4. **Digital Transformation Focus:** The formal designation of Aadarsh Rohira as Chief Digital & Information Officer signals Orient Electric's commitment to digital transformation in its operations.

5. **Core Leadership Stability:** MD & CEO Ravindra Singh Negi (since May 2024) and the board composition remain stable, providing continuity at the top.
