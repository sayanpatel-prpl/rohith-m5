## 4. Strategic Interpretation

- **Board Strengthening & Formalization:** The 2025 re-designations of Jasbir Singh and Daljit Singh, along with Sachin Gupta's elevation to the Board, indicate a formalization and strengthening of the leadership structure. This aligns with Amber Enterprises' rapid growth trajectory as India's largest OEM for room air conditioners.
- **Operational Focus:** Sachin Gupta's appointment as ED & WTD reflects the company's focus on operational leadership for its Consumer Durable division, which has been a key growth driver.
- **Continuity:** The re-designations of the Singh brothers (Jasbir as Chairman/CEO and Daljit as MD) suggest continuity of promoter leadership with clearer role delineation.

## 5. Evidence Gaps & Open Items

| # | Gap |
|---|-----|
| 1 | Exact effective dates for 2025 board re-designations and Sachin Gupta's appointment could not be confirmed from publicly available sources. The Register of Director for Sachin Gupta was uploaded in March 2025, suggesting the appointment was around that time. |
| 2 | No BSE filing text could be retrieved for the specific board restructuring announcement. |
| 3 | Any changes at subsidiary level (e.g., IL JIN/Stelltek – Sudhir Goyal appointed director on 15 Feb 2026) were not explored in depth as they pertain to subsidiary governance. |
