- **TM Roh** appointed as CEO and Head of Device eXperience (DX) Division (dual-CEO system with Young Hyun Jun)
- **Park Hong-kun** (Harvard professor) appointed as President and Head of Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), effective January 1, 2026

- Impact of Samsung Electronics' global November 2025 executive reshuffle on Samsung India leadership is not confirmed
- Any changes to Korean-nominated directors during 2025 could not be verified from public sources
