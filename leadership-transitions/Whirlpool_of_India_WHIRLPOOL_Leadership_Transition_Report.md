## 3. Continuing Roles (No Change in Period)

| Executive Name | Role | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------|
| Narasimhan Eswar | Managing Director | Serving since April 2023; part of Board transition committee |
| Arvind Uppal | Chairman (Non-Executive) | Continuing as Chairman |
| Aditya Jain | Chief Financial Officer | Serving since 2020; continuing |
| Anuj Lall | Executive Director | Appointed September 2024; continuing |
| Rahul Bhatnagar | Independent Director | Chairman of transition committee |
| Harita Gupta | Independent Director | Member of transition committee |

**Note:** The Board constituted a transition committee in response to Whirlpool Corporation's anticipated sell-down announced on 30-Jan-2025 (reducing stake from 51% to 20%). This committee comprises Rahul Bhatnagar, Harita Gupta, Anil Berera, and Narasimhan Eswar.

---

## 4. Strategic Interpretation

- **Ownership Transition:** The dominant theme is Whirlpool Corporation's announced sell-down of its India subsidiary stake, driving the formation of a Board transition committee and Board strengthening efforts.
- **Board Strengthening:** Re-appointments of multiple Independent Directors (Suresh Katyal, Deepti Sehgal, Kumaresh Chandra Misra) and re-categorization of Anil Berera as Independent Director suggest efforts to ensure governance stability during the ownership transition.
- **Operational Stability:** No changes in the MD (Narasimhan Eswar), CFO (Aditya Jain), or ED (Anuj Lall) roles indicate operational continuity despite the significant ownership change underway.
