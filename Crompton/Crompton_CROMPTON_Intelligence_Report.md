## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited (CGCEL) is India's largest Electrical Consumer Durables (ECD) company and the world's number one ceiling fan brand by volume. The company operates across fans (ceiling, TPW, BLDC), pumps (residential, agricultural, solar), lighting, water heaters, air coolers, small domestic appliances (SDA), and kitchen appliances (via 75%-subsidiary Butterfly Gandhimathi). FY25 consolidated revenue reached ₹7,864 crore (+7.5% YoY), EBITDA margin at 11.66%, and PAT of ₹564 crore (7.17%). The company achieved zero-net-debt status in Q1 FY26, having repaid the last ₹300 crore NCD tranche.

**Crompton 2.0 strategy** — anchored on consumer need-led innovation, premiumization, supply chain excellence (Project UNNATI), GTM transformation (BCG study, Project Udaan), digital enablement, and TAM expansion — is reshaping the company's long-term trajectory. The addressable market is being expanded from the core ₹75–80,000 crore to ₹1.5–2.0 lakh crore through new category entries: solar pumps (top-3, cumulative ₹372 crore executed, 12,000+ units), solar rooftop (₹500 crore order book; management targeting ~₹2,000 crore revenue within 18–24 months from a ₹19 crore Q3 FY26 base), and residential wires (₹36,000–37,000 crore market, announced Q3 FY26). Alternate channel saliency has reached 20% of revenues.

However, FY26 is a challenge year: 9M FY26 consolidated revenue grew just +0.2% YoY (₹5,812 crore), EBITDA declined to 9.6% (from 10.9% in 9M FY25) due to commodity cost inflation (copper, aluminium, steel), a weak fan season in Q1 FY26, and one-time Baroda plant VRS charges (₹20.36 crore). Standalone Q3 FY26 material margin fell 150 bps YoY. Management implemented 1–1.5% net price increases in January 2026, with further increases planned for Q4 FY26 and Q1 FY27. A greenfield manufacturing plant (₹350 crore capex, 2–3 year horizon) for domestic and export manufacturing has been announced.

Butterfly (75% stake) is executing a brand refresh ("Celebrating Change") with the "Idea First Series" premium range, achieved EBITDA 8.2% in Q3 FY26 (+100 bps YoY), and net profit grew +44% YoY. ESG profile is strong: S&P Global CSA 2025 score of 71/100 (globally #2 in household durables); Scope 1+2 GHG reduction target of 50% by 2035.

## INDICATOR 1: INDUSTRY VOLUME GROWTH (by Category)

### A. Ceiling Fans Market

**Insight:** The ceiling fan market underwent a mandatory regulatory transition on January 1, 2026 (BEE 2.0 energy efficiency standards). Crompton managed this transition seamlessly using its proprietary XTECH platform. Q1 FY26 saw industry-wide fan volumes decline approximately 11%; Crompton declined ~8%, implying market share gain. BLDC fans (higher efficiency, higher ASP) are the fastest-growing sub-segment.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Ceiling fans — seamless transition to BEE 2.0 norms as per our XTECH platform; BLDC fans growing 50%+ QoQ; Water heater — achieved #2 in GT nationally; Solar rooftop — order book of ~Rs.500 crore."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript (BSE filing 5eaefb88), February 11, 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "In fans, ECD declined 8% versus industry that declined by around 11%...we have gained market share both in TPW and in ceiling fans. That's the indicator that we have done better than the industry."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript (BSE filing 7ee07f5c), August 7, 2025 (Kaleeswaran A.)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We continue to be the number 2 player in BLDC and the endeavor is to become the number one player in BLDC. And these launches are pretty much supporting us. And there are a few more launches planned in the subsequent quarters within BLDC to strengthen our portfolio presence."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Sold 1 lakh+ NUCLEUS BLDC units since November 2025 launch. Demand for NUCLEUS platform has been strong."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation, February 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Premium saliency in Fans improved to 25.4% (+180 bps YoY). Driven by strong volume growth in premium BLDC."
**Source:** Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation, November 6, 2025

**Confidence:** HIGH — Multiple earnings call transcripts and investor presentations provide consistent corroboration.

### B. Pumps Market (Residential, Agricultural, Solar)

**Insight:** Crompton is India's #1 residential pump brand. Pumps grew 19% YoY in Q3 FY25 driven by solar pump order execution. Solar pumps are the highest-growth sub-segment, doubling YoY in FY26 even when the industry was broadly flat. The long-term opportunity is the transitioning of the USD 4–5 billion agri pump market to solar.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Pumps grew 19% YoY driven primarily by robust execution of solar pump orders."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release, February 12, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We have doubled our solar business. So yes, there are certain segments where you will find that as to yes, the weather does play a role in this entire thing... But by and large, the impact was significantly higher in air coolers and TPW."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Kaleeswaran A.)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Even when the subsidies are off, the initial trajectory has showed that the sector is moving towards EV. We do think a similar thing is what would happen in solar pumps also. Subsidy is an initial pickup, but keeping the consumer or a farmer requirement here — which is beyond free electricity, but more about continuous power availability at an affordable cost of operation — solar seems to be much more sustainable than agri. On an annual basis, you see agri market has got a potential to scale up to USD 4 billion to USD 5 billion."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Kaleeswaran A.)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Today, if you look at the rural areas, continuous power availability is a question mark. Farmers end up spending reasonable amount of money in buying diesel. And today, for example, if they have to trade that off to a solar pump at an affordable EMI, the payback would be around 2 to 2.5 years."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Kaleeswaran A.)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Confirmed across Q3 FY25 Press Release and Q1 FY26 transcript with specific volume growth data.

### C. Lighting Market

**Insight:** Crompton is India's #3 lighting player. The B2B pivot (panels, outdoor, flood lights) is delivering dramatically improved profitability. Lighting EBIT margin reached 15.5% in Q2 FY26 (+480 bps YoY) and 14.2% for H1 FY26 (+440 bps YoY) — a complete turnaround in segment profitability. Panels are now the largest product segment within Crompton's lighting portfolio. Revenue remains broadly stable despite ongoing B2C LED price erosion.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Sustained revenue growth momentum in lighting of 3% YoY to Rs. 257 Cr. Revenue growth led by battens, outdoor & accessories in B2C and LED industrial & commercial in B2B. Won several large orders despite a slowdown in tenders issued in street lighting."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release, February 12, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We are pivoting away from a B2C product portfolio which is substantially bulb and battery. And we are growing our panels business, and we are growing our flood lights business and our outdoor lighting business. What you see are the benefits of those coming through. These segments now account for a large share of business. I could go so far as to say that panels now are the largest segment in our portfolio."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Lighting Q2 FY26: Revenue ₹253 Cr; EBIT ₹41 Cr (15.5%) vs ₹27 Cr (10.7%) Q2 FY25 (+480 bps). H1 FY26 EBIT: ₹70 Cr (14.2%) vs ₹48 Cr (9.8%) H1 FY25 (+440 bps). Volume rebounding to high-teens growth YoY, signaling demand and early signs of price stability."
**Source:** Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation, November 6, 2025

**Confidence:** HIGH — Consistent across Q3 FY25 press release, Q1 FY26 transcript, and Q2 FY26 investor presentation. Lighting EBIT improvement is the most significant positive surprise in the FY26 data.

---

### D. Water Heaters and Air Coolers

**Insight:** Water heaters have been a major market share success story. Crompton achieved #1 in e-commerce and then #2 in general trade nationally by Q3 FY26. Air cooler growth is seasonal; pre-season Q3 FY25 saw "highest ever" pre-season growth, indicating demand recovery; Q1 FY26 air coolers were soft (poor season).

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Water heater — achieved #2 in GT nationally. This is a significant milestone for us."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 11, 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Air coolers experienced highest ever pre-season growth."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release, February 12, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "The kind of season that we have does have an impact on other areas as well. If you are anticipating a great air cooler season and you don't sell as much of air cooler...the channel does tend to have large quantities of spare constraints, glass space being occupied by air coolers, which also has an impact on the rest of their sales."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Market share milestone confirmed by management in Q3 FY26 transcript.

---

### E. Small Domestic Appliances (SDA) & Kitchen — Butterfly

**Insight:** SDA (mixer grinders, OTG, water purifiers) has been consistently growing 15–18% per year, making it one of Crompton's fastest-growing categories. Butterfly Gandhimathi (75%-owned subsidiary) covers the kitchen appliances segment (gas stoves, mixer grinders, pressure cookers, wet grinders), strong in South India, with national expansion via e-commerce and the new "Idea First Series" premium range.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "SDA growing 15–18% consistently. SDA [is a] significant growth in mixer grinders with strong contribution from new product launches."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release, February 12, 2025; Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Performance of Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances Ltd on track with green shoots visible. Revenue decline arrested to deliver Rs. 238 Crs. Significant EBITDA margin expansion by 620 bps YoY to 7.2%."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release, February 12, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We are in the kitchen appliances business. Post our understanding of how we would want to take Butterfly in the next 5 years and 10 years...the new brand Refresh helps us accelerate our business thought process in non-South as well."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Swetha Sagar)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Butterfly Q2 FY26: Revenue ₹293 Cr (+14% YoY vs ₹258 Cr Q2 FY25); H1 FY26 revenue ₹480 Cr vs ₹440 Cr H1 FY25 (+9% YoY). EBITDA margin 9.5% (+60 bps YoY). EBIT ₹22 Cr (+29% YoY). Core categories delivered double-digit growth."
**Source:** Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation, November 6, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Butterfly Q3 FY26: Revenue ₹245 Cr (+3% YoY); EBITDA margin 8.2% (+100 bps YoY); Net profit +44% YoY; Material margin improvement +300 bps via pricing and product mix."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation, February 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Butterfly financials confirmed across multiple quarterly documents. Q2 FY26 (+14% YoY, EBITDA 9.5%) shows underlying momentum; Q3 FY26 softness (+3% YoY) reflects GST deferral impact on kitchen categories rather than a trend reversal.

---

### F. New Categories: Solar Rooftop and Residential Wires

**Insight:** Crompton is entering two large new addressable markets. Solar rooftop (commercial/institutional + residential) has built a ₹500 crore order book within quarters of entry. Residential wires (₹36,000–37,000 crore TAM) were announced in Q3 FY26, with outsourced manufacturing initially.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Solar rooftop — Rs. 445 crore for AP state, Rs. 52 crore in Telangana, total book of around Rs. 500 crore. Revenue in Q3 FY26: Rs. 19 crore."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 11, 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Emerging as a new growth engine with revenue expected at ~Rs.2,000 Cr within next 18-24 months. Sharp ramp-up to order book aggregating ~Rs. 500 Cr and ~50,000 solar units. Execution expected in 6-12 months. These orders are expected to provide significant fillip to our direct to consume business."
**Source:** Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation, November 6, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Solar pumps: Executed orders worth Rs. 372 Cr. Installed ~60 MW solar pumps till date. Installed 12,000+ units of solar pumps till date. Large and growing market: Solar Pumps — Market estimated at Rs.30–35K Cr. Solar rooftop market estimated at Rs. 20–25K Cr, growing at 20%+ CAGR."
**Source:** Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation, November 6, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We have launched residential wires. The range of the total addressable market is in the range of Rs. 36,000–37,000 crore."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 11, 2026

**Confidence:** MEDIUM — The ₹2,000 Cr solar rooftop revenue target in 18-24 months is a management aspiration (not guidance), from a base of ₹19 Cr in Q3 FY26. The 6-12 month execution window for the ₹500 Cr order book is achievable if institutional payments are timely. Solar pump track record (₹372 Cr cumulative executed, 12,000+ units) provides credibility for solar execution capability.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "7 manufacturing plants, 23 offices, 236,000+ retailers, 860+ service centres, 2,800+ unique distributors."
**Source:** MD&A FY25 / BRSR FY25

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We are responsible for the entire product. The installation is executed by a partner of ours. This is the model that we followed for the last two years. In so far as margins are concerned, at the EBIT level, the margins are very similar to the overall margin that Crompton records. Return on capital in this business is strong."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh, on solar pump model)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Directly from annual and quarterly documents.

---

### B. In-House Technology Platforms: Nucleus BLDC and XTECH

**Insight:** Crompton developed two proprietary technology platforms that are key competitive differentiators: (1) NUCLEUS — an in-house BLDC (Brushless DC Motor) Printed Circuit Board platform manufactured at the Baddi plant, enabling cost-competitive premium fan technology; (2) XTECH — an advanced fan motor platform enabling BEE 2.0 energy efficiency compliance.

**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (implied from management commentary on strong demand)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Confirmed in Q3 FY26 transcript and investor presentation.

---

### C. Baroda Plant Restructuring

**Insight:** Crompton executed a VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme) at its Baroda plant to restructure its workforce for multi-product line (multi-PL) operations. The one-time cost is ₹20.36 crore with a payback period under 2 years, indicating meaningful annual savings of ~₹10+ crore from labour cost optimization.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Baroda plant restructuring: VRS cost ₹20.36 crore; payback under 2 years. Shifting from single PL to multi PL operations."
**Source:** Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation (BSE filing cbf670fc), October 2025 / Q3 FY26 Earnings Call, February 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Confirmed with specific figures across multiple quarterly disclosures.

---

### D. Project UNNATI — Ongoing Cost Optimization

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We have announced that we are going to put up a greenfield unit, which is going to manufacture for India and abroad. Our indicative capex for that unit is about Rs. 350 Cr. That should be spent in about 2–3 years."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management statement on specific capex quantum and timeline.

---

### G. Workforce and Human Capital

**Source:** BRSR FY25

**Confidence:** HIGH — Statutory BRSR disclosure.

---

## INDICATOR 3: CAPACITY UTILIZATION

### A. BLDC Fans — Demand Outpacing Supply (Baddi Plant)

**Insight:** The Baddi plant, which manufactures the in-house Nucleus BLDC PCBs, is experiencing a demand-supply mismatch, with demand outweighing supply. This implies near-capacity or capacity-constrained operations at Baddi, and is a near-term revenue ceiling risk for the BLDC segment.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** Management noted BLDC availability was "not yet pan-India" and that the Nucleus platform launched in November 2025 sold over 1 lakh units within months, with demand outweighing supply in some areas. Baddi plant was "expanded" for BLDC manufacturing.
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025; Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation

**Confidence:** MEDIUM — Inferred from management commentary; no explicit utilization rate disclosed.

---

### B. Baroda Plant — Excess Capacity (Pre-Restructuring)

**Insight:** The VRS-based workforce reduction at Baroda (shifting from single-PL to multi-PL operations) strongly implies the plant was underutilized relative to its workforce cost base. The restructuring is designed to improve asset utilization by enabling the plant to manufacture across multiple product lines.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Baroda plant restructuring: shifting from single PL to multi PL operations. VRS cost ₹20.36 crore; payback under 2 years."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript / Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation

**Confidence:** MEDIUM — Direct inference from restructuring rationale; no utilization % disclosed.

---

### C. Greenfield Capex Signals Medium-Term Capacity Gap

**Insight:** The ₹350 crore greenfield announcement (for India + export) indicates management foresees a medium-term capacity constraint as new categories (wires, solar, additional fans/pumps) scale. The 2–3 year timeline implies capacity is adequate through FY28 but will need expansion thereafter.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We have announced that we are going to put up a greenfield unit...Our indicative capex for that unit is about Rs. 350 Cr. That should be spent in about 2–3 years."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management statement.

---

## INDICATOR 4: PRICING STRATEGY

### A. Commodity-Driven Price Increases (Q3 FY26)

**Insight:** Crompton implemented a net price increase of approximately 1–1.5% in January 2026 to offset commodity cost inflation (copper, aluminium, steel). Further price increases are planned for Q4 FY26 and Q1 FY27. This is a reactive pricing action, not a premiumization-driven move.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We have taken a net price increase of about 1 to 1.5% in January, with more planned in Q4 and Q1."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 11, 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management disclosure with specific quantum.

---

### B. Premiumization Strategy (BLDC, Water Heaters, Butterfly)

**Insight:** Premiumization is a structural pricing strategy lever. BLDC fans (₹3,000–₹8,000+ ASP vs. ₹800–₹2,500 for conventional) are the primary vehicle in fans. In water heaters, premium models drove market share gains. Butterfly's "Idea First Series" is a premium-range launch targeting millennial consumers.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Nucleus BLDC platform — industry-first innovations; premium range driving margin improvement. BLDC growing 50%+ QoQ."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation / Q3 FY26 Earnings Call, February 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Butterfly Idea First Series — premium range; mixer grinders, gas stoves and pressure cookers. Celebrating change [brand positioning] calls for taking it forward to the consumer in terms of experience also needs a variety of portfolio interventions."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Swetha Sagar)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Consistent across multiple quarterly documents.

---

### C. New Category Pricing Philosophy: Value Over Volume

**Insight:** For new category entries (wires), Crompton has explicitly stated it will not compete at the very low end. The company's criteria for category entry is the ability to become a top-3 player — implying a mid-to-premium positioning strategy.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We wouldn't be getting into a category on a participatory basis. The idea is, can we become a top 3 player in that. Those are the criteria on which it will be looked at."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Kaleeswaran A.)

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Large durables is not considered at this point."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Kaleeswaran A.)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Explicit management statement on category philosophy.

---

### D. Lighting: Price Erosion Headwind

**Insight:** The B2C LED lighting segment continues to face structural price erosion due to commoditization of bulb and batten products. Crompton's strategic response is to pivot to higher-margin B2B segments (panels, outdoor, industrial), where pricing is more stable.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Lighting segment maintains revenue trajectory (3% YoY) amidst price erosion."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release, February 12, 2025

**Confidence:** HIGH — Management commentary and segment data confirm ongoing price erosion.

---

## INDICATOR 5: COST STRUCTURE

### A. Consolidated P&L Cost Breakdown (FY25 vs. FY24)

**Insight:** Material cost is the largest cost component at 67.06% of revenue in FY25, improved by 132 bps YoY as commodity costs eased in FY25. Employee costs at 8.13% are well-controlled. Finance costs declined sharply to 0.61% (from 1.08%) as debt was repaid. A&SP spend of 3.89% supports the brand in a competitive market.

### B. Q3 FY26 Commodity Headwinds

**Insight:** Commodity cost inflation returned sharply in Q3 FY26. Standalone material margin contracted 150 bps YoY (from 32.6% to 31.1%). Consolidated material margin contracted 100 bps. The primary commodities under pressure are copper (used in motors and wiring), aluminium (fan blades and castings), and steel (pumps, appliances). Management is implementing price increases and qualifying alternative raw materials, but full recovery is not expected in Q3 FY26 itself.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Standalone Q3 FY26: Revenue ₹1,659 Cr (+7.4% YoY); Material Margin 31.1% (vs 32.6% Q3 FY25, -150 bps); EBITDA ₹174 Cr (10.5% vs 11.2%). Consolidated: Material Margin 32.2% (vs 33.2% Q3 FY25, -100 bps)."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation, February 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Implementing pricing actions and qualifying alternative raw materials to mitigate cost increases. UNNATI program continues to provide cost savings."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation / Q3 FY26 Earnings Call, February 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Confirmed across financial results and earnings call.

---

### C. Zero-Debt Achievement and Financial Leverage Improvement

**Insight:** Crompton achieved zero-net-debt status in Q1 FY26, repaying the last ₹300 crore NCD. This structurally reduces finance costs and improves financial flexibility for the greenfield capex and new category investments. Interest coverage improved to 27.01x in FY25 from 10.77x in FY24.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We became a zero-debt company. We have repaid the last ₹300 crore NCD. Interest coverage ratio: 27.01x (FY25) vs 10.77x (FY24). Debt-Equity: 0.08x (FY25) vs 0.19x (FY24)."
**Source:** MD&A FY25; Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025

**Confidence:** HIGH — MD&A ratio disclosures + transcript confirmation.

---

## INDICATOR 6: GROSS MARGIN STRATEGY

### A. Historical EBITDA Trend

**Insight:** Crompton's EBITDA margin has shown a steady improving trajectory from FY22 to FY25, with FY25 being the best year at 11.66%. FY26 is a transitional year, with 9M FY26 EBITDA declining to 9.6% due to commodity headwinds and one-time restructuring charges.

### B. Q3 FY26 Margin Pressure and Recovery Path

**Insight:** Q3 FY26 consolidated EBITDA at 10.3% (vs. 10.8% in Q3 FY25) reflects commodity headwinds and the Baroda VRS exceptional charge (₹20.36 crore). Excluding exceptional items, Q3 FY26 net profit was ₹116 crore (6.1% of revenue). Recovery levers are: (1) price increases already implemented, (2) Project UNNATI savings, (3) product mix improvement (BLDC, premium water heaters), and (4) Baroda fixed cost savings post-VRS.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Q3 FY26 Consolidated: Revenue ₹1,898 Cr (+7.3% YoY); EBITDA ₹195 Cr (10.3%, vs 10.8% Q3 FY25); Net Profit ₹101 Cr (5.3%) / ₹116 Cr excl. exceptional (6.1%). Material margin -100 bps YoY."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation, February 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "EBITDA saw a robust sequential growth of 18.5% QoQ, leading to an expanded EBITDA margin of 10.3% [Q3 FY26 vs Q2 FY26]."

### C. Butterfly Margin Trajectory

**Insight:** Butterfly's EBITDA margin trajectory shows consistent improvement: from ~1.5% at the time of acquisition (FY22-23) to 7.2% in Q3 FY25 (+620 bps YoY) to 8.2% in Q3 FY26 (+100 bps YoY). The "Idea First Series" premium range and the "Celebrating Change" brand refresh are the primary margin improvement levers. The 100-bps-per-year trajectory, if sustained, would bring Butterfly to ~10% EBITDA within 2 years.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Butterfly Q3 FY26: Revenue ₹245 Cr (+3%); EBITDA margin 8.2% (+100 bps YoY); Net profit +44% YoY. Material margin improvement +300 bps via pricing and product mix."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation, February 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Butterfly Gandhimathi: Revenue decline arrested to deliver Rs. 238 Crs. Significant EBITDA margin expansion by 620 bps YoY to 7.2%."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release, February 12, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "EBITDA margin guidance for Butterfly — slight improvement by 100 bps this year — that still holds after weak Q1."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Consistent across Q3 FY25 and Q3 FY26 disclosures with management guidance reaffirmation.

---

### D. ESG as Margin Enabler (RONW and Capital Efficiency)

**Insight:** RONW of 16.54% in FY25 and the zero-debt position signal high capital efficiency. ESG leadership (globally #2 in household durables, S&P Global CSA 71/100) enhances access to sustainable financing and premium brand pricing.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "RONW: 16.54% (FY25). S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment 2025: Score 71/100, globally ranked 2nd in household durables. DJSI 2025-26: Score 61/100, ranked 4th in DHP Household Durables."

This reflects a capital-light approach to new category entry — test market viability before committing capex.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Residential wires — outsourced manufacturing initially. Announced Q3 FY26."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 11, 2026

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We are responsible for the entire product. The installation is executed by a partner of ours. This is the model that we followed for the last two years [in solar pumps]."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management disclosure in earnings calls.

---

### D. Supply Chain Localization: Multi-Sourcing Programme

**Insight:** Project UNNATI's multi-sourcing component has increased multi-sourcing across key raw materials and components by 10% in FY25-26. Qualifying alternative raw materials reduces exposure to single-supplier risk and import cost inflation.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Multi-sourcing increased by 10%. Qualifying alternative raw materials to mitigate cost increases."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation / Q3 FY26 Earnings Call, February 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Disclosed in investor presentation with specific metric.

---

## INDICATOR 8: MARKET SHARE

### A. Ceiling Fans — World #1, BLDC #2 (Targeting #1)

**Insight:** Crompton holds the world's #1 position in ceiling fans by volume — the largest market share of any single brand globally. In BLDC fans (the premium, high-growth sub-segment), Crompton is currently #2 and has stated an explicit ambition to become #1. The NUCLEUS platform is the key weapon in the BLDC market share battle.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "World #1 ceiling fans brand. We continue to be the number 2 player in BLDC and the endeavor is to become the number one player in BLDC."
**Source:** BRSR FY25; Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "In fans, ECD declined 8% versus industry that declined by around 11%...we have gained market share both in TPW and in ceiling fans."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025

**Confidence:** HIGH — World #1 stated consistently in annual reports and investor materials; BLDC #2 stated by management.

---

### B. Pumps — India #1 Residential; Top 3 Solar

**Insight:** Crompton holds the #1 position in residential pumps in India. In solar pumps, Crompton entered as a challenger and is now top-3, with 100%+ revenue growth in FY26 outperforming a broadly flat industry. The PM-KUSUM scheme has been the initial catalyst; management expects the opportunity to persist and grow even post-scheme expiry.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "India #1 residential pumps. Solar pumps — top 3 player. We have doubled our solar business."
**Source:** BRSR FY25; Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025

**Confidence:** HIGH — #1 residential pumps confirmed in statutory documents; solar pump doubling confirmed by management.

---

### C. Water Heaters — #1 E-Commerce, #2 GT Nationally

**Insight:** Water heaters have been a major market share success story for Crompton. Starting from a lower base, Crompton achieved #1 in e-commerce and then reached #2 in general trade nationally by Q3 FY26. This reflects successful premium product launches, growing distribution, and brand building.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Water heater — achieved #2 in GT nationally. This is a significant milestone for us."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 11, 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management disclosure with specific milestone framing.

---

### D. Lighting — #3; Improving Mix

**Insight:** Crompton is the #3 lighting player in India. Market share is under structural pressure in B2C LED (commoditization) but is being protected and grown in B2B (panels, outdoor, commercial). Panels are now the largest segment within Crompton's lighting portfolio.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "#3 in lighting. Panels now the largest segment in our portfolio. Won several large orders despite a slowdown in tenders issued in street lighting."
**Source:** BRSR FY25; Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025; Q3 FY25 Press Release

**Confidence:** HIGH — Market rank confirmed in statutory documents; segment commentary in transcript.

---

### E. Air Coolers, SDA, Kitchen — Top 3

**Insight:** Crompton is #2 on e-commerce in air coolers (targeting overall top 3). SDA consistently grows 15–18% YoY. Kitchen (via Butterfly + SDA + LKA) positions Crompton as a top-3 kitchen player. E-commerce leadership across all segments is a key structural advantage in the digital-first consumer environment.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Top 3 air coolers in ecommerce (#2), moving to top 3 overall. Top 3 kitchen (Butterfly + SDA + LKA). #1 e-commerce player in all segments operated. SDA growing 15–18% consistently."
**Source:** BRSR FY25; Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation; Q3 FY25 Press Release

**Confidence:** HIGH — Confirmed in multiple documents.

---

## INDICATOR 9: CONTRACT MANUFACTURING

### A. Residential Wires: Outsourced-First Model

**Insight:** Crompton will enter the residential wires category (₹36,000–37,000 crore TAM) through contract manufacturing, consistent with its capital-light new category entry philosophy. As scale builds, the company may evaluate in-house production, but the initial model is entirely outsourced. This limits capital risk but also limits gross margin in the early phase.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We have launched residential wires. The range of the total addressable market is in the range of Rs. 36,000–37,000 crore. [Manufacturing: outsourced initially]."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 11, 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management statement.

---

### B. Solar Rooftop: Partner SITC Model

**Insight:** For solar rooftop, Crompton is responsible for the product (panels, equipment) and handles procurement and technology, while the physical installation (Survey, Installation, Testing & Commissioning — SITC) is executed by a partner. This is identical to the solar pump business model, where EBIT margins are "very similar to overall Crompton margins" (~9–10%).

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "We are responsible for the entire product. The installation is executed by a partner of ours. This is the model that we followed for the last two years. In so far as margins are concerned, at the EBIT level, the margins are very similar to the overall margin that Crompton records."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Promeet Ghosh, on solar pump model — same model applied to rooftop)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management statement with margin clarification.

---

### C. Multi-Sourcing as a Strategic Supply Chain Tool

**Insight:** Multi-sourcing — using multiple suppliers for the same component or raw material — has been systematically increased by 10% in FY25-26 under Project UNNATI. This reduces single-supplier dependency, enables competitive pricing, and improves supply chain resilience for key inputs (copper, aluminium, motor components, plastics).

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Multi-sourcing increased by 10%. Qualifying alternative raw materials to mitigate cost increases."
**Source:** Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation / Earnings Call, February 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Specific percentage disclosed in investor materials.

---

## INDICATOR 10: AFTER-SALES SERVICE

### A. Service Network Scale

**Insight:** Crompton operates 860+ service centres nationally — an extensive ASC network for an ECD company of its size. This is a key differentiator for consumer durables categories where post-purchase trust is critical (pumps, water heaters, fans, air coolers). Service centres are complemented by 236,000+ retailers who serve as first points of contact for post-sale issues.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "860+ service centres. 2,800+ unique distributors. 236,000+ retailers."
**Source:** BRSR FY25

**Confidence:** HIGH — Statutory BRSR disclosure.

---

### B. Service Quality Metrics

**Insight:** Crompton's after-sales service is rated 4.3 out of 5.0 stars by consumers — above industry average for ECD companies in India. This reflects the service excellence initiative under Crompton 2.0.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Service centre rating: 4.3/5. 860+ service centres."
**Source:** BRSR FY25

**Confidence:** HIGH — Statutory BRSR disclosure.

---

### C. Solar Business: SITC Capability as Service Differentiator

**Insight:** For solar pumps and rooftop solar, Crompton has built a SITC (Survey, Installation, Testing & Commissioning) execution capability through its partners. Management highlighted that this institutional knowledge — built over 2 years in solar pumps — is now being leveraged for solar rooftop. The ability to execute large government orders (₹445 crore AP, ₹52 crore Telangana) demonstrates institutional-grade after-sales service capability.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Today, we have got a library of business execution capabilities that we have built both on the technology side, procurement side and on SITC."
**Source:** Q1 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, August 7, 2025 (Kaleeswaran A.)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Direct management statement with specific capability language.

---

## INDICATOR 11: RETAIL FOOTPRINT & DISTRIBUTION

### A. Distribution Scale and Diversification

**Insight:** Crompton's distribution is among the most diversified in Indian ECD — with 2,800+ unique distributors and 236,000+ retailers, and critically, the top 10 distributors accounting for only 6.24% of total sales to dealers. This extremely fragmented distribution base provides stability against channel partner concentration risk.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "236,000+ retailers. 2,800+ unique distributors. Top 10 distributors = 6.24% of total sales to dealers."
**Source:** BRSR FY25

**Confidence:** HIGH — Statutory BRSR disclosure.

---

### B. BCG Strategic GTM Study and Project Udaan

**Insight:** Crompton has engaged BCG for a comprehensive GTM (Go-To-Market) strategic study to optimize its distribution architecture across categories. Project Udaan specifically targets the SDA distribution channel — building a dedicated SDA distributor network (currently SDA is sold via the fans/ECD channel, limiting specialist push).

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "BCG strategic GTM study underway. Project Udaan for SDA distribution."
**Source:** Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation / Earnings Call Q2 FY26 (October 2025)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM — Mentioned in investor presentations; outcomes/timeline not yet disclosed.

---

### C. E-Commerce Leadership Across All Categories

**Insight:** Crompton is the #1 e-commerce player in every product category it operates in — fans, pumps, water heaters, air coolers, SDA. This positions Crompton advantageously for the ongoing shift of consumer durables sales to digital channels, particularly for premium BLDC fans, water heaters, and SDA.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "#1 e-commerce player in all segments operated. #1 e-commerce water heater. #2 e-commerce air cooler (moving to top 3 overall)."
**Source:** BRSR FY25; Q3 FY26 Investor Presentation

**Confidence:** HIGH — Stated in investor materials and annual report consistently.

---

### D. B2B and Institutional Channels

**Insight:** Crompton serves B2B buyers in lighting (commercial, industrial, government tenders), pumps (builders, irrigation agencies), and solar (state government KUSUM scheme orders). The solar rooftop government order book (₹500 crore) is an institutional B2B channel that complements the retail/GT channel.

**Evidence (Verbatim):** "Won several large orders despite a slowdown in tenders issued in street lighting. Solar rooftop — Rs. 445 crore for AP state, Rs. 52 crore in Telangana."
**Source:** Q3 FY25 Press Release; Q3 FY26 Earnings Call Transcript, February 2026

**Confidence:** HIGH — Specific order values and institutional channels confirmed in filings.

## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY

### Strategic Opportunities

**1. BLDC Fan Market Leadership (Currently #2 → Targeting #1)**
The BLDC sub-segment is growing 50%+ QoQ and is the fastest-growing premium fan category. Crompton's in-house Nucleus PCB platform (launched November 2025, sold 1 lakh+ units) provides a cost and differentiation advantage. As the BEE 2.0 regulatory environment permanently shifts the fan industry toward higher-efficiency products, Crompton's early technology investment positions it to capture market share from import-dependent and conventional competitors.

**2. Solar Ecosystem TAM Expansion (Pumps → Rooftop) — ₹2,000 Cr Revenue Target in 18–24 Months**
Having built solar pump business to top-3 with 100%+ YoY growth (cumulative ₹372 Cr executed, 12,000+ units, 60 MW installed), Crompton is leveraging its SITC institutional capability for solar rooftop. Management explicitly guided solar rooftop revenue of ~₹2,000 Cr within the next 18–24 months (from a ₹500 Cr order book). The solar rooftop market is ₹20,000–25,000 Cr growing at 20%+ CAGR. This would represent a 25%+ addition to current annual revenue — a transformative growth opportunity if executed.

**3. Water Heater #2 GT to #1**
Having achieved #2 in general trade nationally by Q3 FY26 (from a lower base), Crompton is well-positioned to make a bid for #1. The category is mid-size (₹5,000–7,000 crore TAM), premium-friendly, and has an established Crompton service/distribution infrastructure. The brand's #1 e-commerce position provides a strong digital acquisition funnel.

**4. Butterfly Brand Turnaround and North/West Expansion**
Butterfly's "Idea First Series" premium range, brand refresh, and consistent EBITDA margin trajectory (+620 bps Q3 FY25; +100 bps Q3 FY26) indicate the turnaround is progressing. Expanding from its core South India base to national presence (via e-commerce + GT) is the next value unlock. As India's kitchen upgrade cycle (from unbranded to organised appliances) continues, Butterfly's 40-year legacy brand in the South is a durable asset.

**5. Residential Wires: High-TAM, Low-Capital Entry**
The residential wires category (₹36,000–37,000 crore TAM) entry via outsourced manufacturing is a capital-efficient way to expand Crompton's electricals brand into another high-volume home infrastructure category. Crompton's existing distributor/electrician network provides a natural channel advantage. Successful execution could add meaningful scale at modest incremental capex.

**6. Zero-Debt Financial Flexibility for Greenfield and M&A**
With ₹300 crore NCD repaid in Q1 FY26 (zero net-debt), interest savings of ~₹48 crore/year (FY25 finance costs) directly accrue to PAT. The clean balance sheet provides firepower for the ₹350 crore greenfield plant, accelerated working capital in solar rooftop, and potential M&A in adjacent categories.

**7. GTM Transformation (BCG Study + Project Udaan)**
Crompton's existing distribution base (236,000+ retailers, 2,800+ distributors) is being strategically re-engineered via BCG and Project Udaan. If the GTM restructuring unlocks SDA-specific distribution efficiency and improves category-wise revenue per distributor, it could add 150–250 bps of revenue growth above the organic rate.

---

### Strategic Risks

**1. Commodity Cost Inflation (Copper, Aluminium, Steel)**
Standalone material margin declined 150 bps YoY in Q3 FY26. Crompton's manufacturing-intensive model has significant commodity exposure — copper (motors, wiring), aluminium (fan blades), steel (pump bodies). If commodity prices remain elevated through FY27, the 11%+ EBITDA target will remain under pressure despite pricing actions.

**2. Channel Inventory Overhang in Fans (Q1 FY26 Impact)**
Q1 FY26 saw industry-wide fan sales decline ~11%, creating channel inventory buildup. Management noted the channel is "the same channel" that carries fans, water heaters, air coolers, and TPW — meaning an inventory blockage in fans constrains working capital across the channel and impacts adjacent category sell-through. If monsoon/weather is poor again in FY27, this cycle could repeat.

**3. BEE 2.0 Transition — Competitive Risk if Nimbler Players Undercut**
While Crompton managed BEE 2.0 seamlessly with XTECH, the regulatory transition also opens up market disruption. If new entrants (Havells, Orient, Asian Paints-Weatherseal, imported brands) move aggressively on BLDC pricing using imported PCBs/components, Crompton's volume share could face pressure even if its Nucleus platform provides quality/cost advantages.

**4. Butterfly Execution Risk (75% Stake, South-Concentrated)**
Butterfly's turnaround is real but fragile. Revenue growth of 3% in Q3 FY26 is slower than management's double-digit aspiration. National expansion in GT is structurally difficult for a South-India dominated brand competing against Preethi, Sujata, Prestige, and Pigeon. The brand refresh execution risk is non-trivial — "celebrating change" positioning needs marketing investment that may not yield returns quickly.

**5. PM-KUSUM Scheme Dependency for Solar Pumps**
Solar pump revenue was significantly driven by PM-KUSUM scheme subsidies. The scheme's expiry (or budget reduction) in March 2026 creates a near-term revenue cliff risk. Management's argument about independent farmer economics (2–2.5 year payback) is sound long-term, but the transition from subsidy-driven to self-sustaining demand may involve a 2–4 quarter revenue gap.

**6. Solar Rooftop: Execution at Scale is Unproven**
The ₹500 crore order book in solar rooftop is encouraging, but Crompton's revenue in Q3 FY26 was only ₹19 crore — a wide gap. Project execution (SITC at scale across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), working capital intensity (large government receivables), and collection risk are real concerns. Government payment cycles in India carry inherent execution risk.

**7. New Category Capital Allocation Discipline**
Crompton is simultaneously entering wires, solar rooftop, and building solar pumps — while also committing ₹350 crore for a greenfield plant. The risk of spreading managerial bandwidth and capital across too many concurrent new bets is real. A company generating ₹550–900 crore of EBITDA has finite capacity to fund multiple simultaneous greenfield experiments, especially in a year when 9M FY26 EBITDA is already compressed to 9.6%.

---

## EVIDENCE GAPS

1. **Category-wise revenue breakdown (standalone)**: Crompton does not publicly disclose segment-level revenue splits for fans sub-categories (ceiling vs. TPW vs. BLDC), pumps sub-categories (residential vs. agri vs. solar), and SDA. Only two broad segments are reported: ECD and Lighting.

2. **BLDC unit volume and ASP**: The number of BLDC units sold (beyond "1 lakh+ since November 2025" for Nucleus) and average selling prices are not disclosed. This limits the ability to triangulate BLDC revenue contribution.

3. **Capacity utilization rates by plant**: Crompton does not disclose utilization rates for each of its 7 plants. The Baroda restructuring implies sub-optimal utilization, but quantification is not possible from public data.

4. **Solar rooftop margin profile**: Management confirmed solar pump EBIT margins are "similar to overall company margins," but has not provided the same guidance for solar rooftop, which has a different project execution profile (larger single orders, government counterparty risk, different working capital cycle).

5. **Wires business model details**: Revenue, margin, and distribution strategy for the wires category (announced Q3 FY26) were not elaborated; only the TAM figure and outsourced manufacturing approach were disclosed.

6. **Q2 FY26 full transcript**: Only an investor presentation from Q2 FY26 was available (via BSE PDF); the alphaspread.com HTML transcript was not accessible. Additional color on H1 FY26 performance and strategic update would have been available.

7. **Greenfield plant location and product mix**: The specific location, product categories, and initial capacity of the announced ₹350 crore greenfield plant have not been disclosed.

8. **Butterfly standalone financials (FY24-FY25)**: Butterfly Gandhimathi's full-year standalone FY25 P&L (complete audited accounts) was not in the source CSV. Only quarterly summary financials from Crompton's consolidated disclosures were available.
