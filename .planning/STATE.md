## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 70 v1 requirements across 14 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3, 4, 5 are independent of each other (all depend on Phase 2 only)
- [Roadmap]: AI intelligence (Phase 7) deferred until all content modules complete (synthesizes across modules)
- [Roadmap]: Export (Phase 9) is last -- requires stable content from all preceding phases
- [01-01]: Static TypeScript brand configs over API-delivered -- no backend dependency, type-safe
- [01-01]: Inline error cards over toasts for section failures -- visible, contextual, Bloomberg panel style
- [01-01]: React 19 use() hook for context consumption, oklch color format for all tokens
- [01-01]: High-density typography: 11px xs, 12px sm, 13px base -- consulting partner scanning speed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md states 58 v1 requirements but actual count is 70. Traceability updated to reflect true count of 70.
