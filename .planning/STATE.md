## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 70 v1 requirements across 14 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3, 4, 5 are independent of each other (all depend on Phase 2 only)
- [Roadmap]: AI intelligence (Phase 7) deferred until all content modules complete (synthesizes across modules)
- [Roadmap]: Export (Phase 9) is last -- requires stable content from all preceding phases

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md states 58 v1 requirements but actual count is 70. Traceability updated to reflect true count of 70.
